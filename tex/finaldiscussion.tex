In this chapter, I first summarise the findings of each study. I then discuss the contribution of this thesis and the practical implications for tools aimed to help workers manage their interruptions in the workplace. Lastly, I discuss any limitations, outstanding questions, and how these could be addressed in future work. 

\section{Summary of findings}
Chapter 3 reported an interview study and an contextual inquiry study looking at the context in which office workers in finance offices conduct data entry work, and how they self-interrupt to look up task-related information during this work. The studies had two contributions. First, there had previously not been many studies that tried to understand data entry behaviour in the uncontrolled setting of an office workplace. Interview findings from Study 1 revealed that a critical component of this type of work is not just entering the data, but collecting this information from various sources distributed in the physical and digital work environment. Second, observations in Study 2 revealed that there was a difference in how physical and digital information is collected. Physical sources take time to access and participants therefore prepared it beforehand, or postponed retrieving it until a more convenient moment in the task. However, computer window switches during the task were commonly observed as workers often realised during the task that they needed additional information, and they presumed these switches to be quick. These switches often took longer than intended, and participants were observed being logged out of the entry system, resuming the wrong data entry task, and reported it took time to resume their work after these longer switches. The hypothesis was made that presumed time involved to collect information played an important part in how people address self-interruptions, and that workers were unaware of the time they actually spend on digital interruptions. Though these qualitative studies gave a better understanding of how data entry work is situated in an office setting and people's self-interruption strategies during this work, the extent to which these strategies were influenced by time costs is unclear. Therefore, a series of lab experiments was carried out to study the effect of time costs on people's switching behaviour in a controlled setting.

Chapter 4 reported three controlled experiments to test the hypothesis that people prioritise collecting information according to time costs: they first switch to information with low time costs, and postpone collecting information with higher time costs. These studies showed that, in a controlled setting where participants can learn the time costs involved in accessing information, they first switch to information sources that are fast to access, and switch more frequently to these sources. On the other hand, people either prepare or postpone looking up information which takes time. Study 3 showed that if people retrieve all data from the same source, they will reduce switches between entering and looking up data if the access costs to this source increases. As it took more time to access, offloading behaviour was observed as well, and several participants prepared items they were going to need nearby, but did not use them yet. Study 4 further demonstrates that when people have to retrieve data from multiple sources, they collect and group items that are quick to access first, and leave items that take longer to access until the end. Study 5 demonstrated the robustness of the effect of time costs in a multi-task setup: when dealing with two data entry tasks, people still entered items with a low time costs first, and interleaved between tasks to enter items with low costs first. As a result, participants made more omission errors and submitted tasks before they had completed entering all the items. These studies contribute to our understanding of time costs on self-interruption behaviour to collect information: if people know the expected time duration of an interruption, they make fewer interruptions that are long and postpone these switches. However, what remained unclear after these studies was how people can learn time costs in a naturalistic setting. An issue with self-interruptions to collect information is that time costs are not always predictable: people may have to spend a longer time than expected looking for information, and they can get distracted during this search. 

Chapter 5 reported an online experiment and a field study looking at whether making people more aware of time costs can be effective in managing self-interruptions during data entry work. This part of the thesis involved developing and evaluating  a browser notification that showed people the average time they spend away from data entry work. These studies contribute to our understanding of how increased awareness of time spent on digital interruptions can help people be more focused on their work, and manage their time away from work. Study 6 found that using an experimental data entry task, people who were shown how long they were away for made shorter window switches, were faster to complete the task and made fewer data entry errors. Study 7 evaluated the intervention with office workers processing expenses. Data from post-study interviews indicated that time feedback made participants reflect on what they were doing during interruptions, and whether they could cut out unnecessary time. 

\section{Contributions}
In order to develop effective interruption management tools, it is important to understand what factors impact people’s self-interruption behaviour, and what type of interventions are most effective in making people adopt more desirable interruption behaviour. My work contributes to interruptions and self-regulation literature by showing how time costs influence self-interruption behaviour, and how information about the time costs of interruptions can help users self-regulate their interruptions. 

I first discuss the contributions this thesis makes to knowledge. I then discuss the practical implications these findings may have to inform the design of future studies as well as interruption management tools. 

%The main contribution of this thesis is an increased understanding of the effect of time costs on people’s self-interruption behaviour to collect task-related information. 

%Contribution to knowledge: expected time effort affects self-itnerruption behaviour: people address them immediately if short
%Contribution to practice: showing people how long they go away for helps reduce length and 

\subsection{Contribution to knowledge}
The first contribution is showing that \textbf{the type of self-interruption influences people’s decision-making in interrupting work}. Prior work has shown that task-irrelevant interruptions are more disruptive than relevant ones \citep{Iqbal2008}. What the studies in Chapter 3 showed was that during data entry work, people are fairly good at avoiding these task-irrelevant interruptions, when they need to briefly focus on a task. However, it is often the interruptions that are needed for work that can be problematic: these cannot be avoided, are presumed to be quick and easy,  but can nevertheless be disruptive, as they can end up being time-consuming and there are various opportunities to get distracted. 

The second contribution is showing that \textbf{the time costs of an interruption influences people’s self-interruption behaviour}. Prior work has shown that when people have to access information and the time cost to access this information increases, they reduce the number of switches, and increase the length of each switch \citep{Gray2006}. Chapter 4 extends this work and shows that if people deal with different time costs, they postpone switching to interruptions with the highest time costs. 

The third contribution is to demonstrate how \textbf{feedback on length of interruptions helps people reflect on actions during, and reduce the length of, their interruptions}. Prior work has shown that people like to be in control of their own interruptions \citep{Mark2018}, but that they often do not know what action to take based on reflective data \citep{Collins2015, Whittaker2016}. Chapter 5 showed that people are able to take action when they are given feedback on the length of their interruptions.

\subsection{Practical implications}
This thesis makes a practical contribution by demonstrating that giving people feedback on the length of their interruptions influences their interruption behaviour: through a better awareness of the length of their interruptions, users reflect on what they were doing during these interruptions, and where possible tried to make them shorter. In this thesis, I focused on a particular type of work and setting: data entry work in financial administration offices. Managing self-interruptions however is not just important for this particular setting, as interruptions and distractions are common in any kind of computer work \citep{Gonzalez2004}. Below I discuss the practical implications of my findings which can inform the design of future studies as well as the design and evaluation of interruption management technologies. 

\textbf{Differentiate between different types of self-interruptions}. This thesis focused on inquiries, a particular type of interruption, and Study 2 and 6 showed that people address this interruption differently than interruptions that are completely unrelated to their current task. Participants in these studies were overall good at avoiding work-irrelevant interruptions, but work-related interruptions were addressed immediately, if they were presumed to be quick and easy. When discussing and making conclusions about people’s self-interruption behaviour, it is important to make a distinction between different types of interruptions.

\textbf{Pay attention to reason for an interruption, not just the source of distraction}. A common approach to improve task focus is to block any sources that are considered distracting from the primary task. However, this blocking approach centralises on the type of information source, but not the type of interruption: an information source may be distracting, but the interruption to access this source may be necessary for a task. Study 2 showed that people often need information sources they consider distracting, such as email, and cannot block these. This means we not only need to consider blocking interruptions that may be distracting from work, but also what support people can be given to control interruptions which are needed for, and considered part of, the task they want to focus on.

\textbf{Make time more explicit}. Interruptions are made for various reasons, and while some may be necessary to progress with work, some are not and are best avoided. Because it is difficult for a tool to determine why interruptions are being made (and whether they are necessary or not), it is better to give users tools to help self-regulate interruptions themselves. The studies in this thesis have shown that people try to avoid long interruptions, which further extends prior research showing how people try to minimise time, and are sensitive to milliseconds \citep{Gray2006}. This thesis has shown however that outside of a controlled setting, these milliseconds may not be that visible. There is therefore a need to make it explicit to people how long certain actions take for them to be able to adapt their behaviour.

\textbf{Consideration needs to be given to where data is retrieved from}. Prior data entry research has primarily focused on improving entry interfaces. For the type of data entry work studied in this thesis, a major part is collecting data in the first place from various locations, and the entry part is actually only a small part of the task. This has implications for future data entry research, as it highlights that more attention needs to be given to the retrieval aspect of a data entry task, which impacts how data is entered. Study 1 showed that office workers tried to batch as much data entry tasks together as possible. A consequence of this was that they had to enter large amounts of data, and did not check their data entries as carefully as when they were checking their own work. Furthermore, when switching between documents, people held items in memory which increases the likelihood of error when returning to the data entry interface. Lastly, Study 1, 2, and 5 highlighted that people often spent long times away from the data entry interface, before they returned. Data entry interfaces should take this into consideration and make it easier to resume a task. Data entry interfaces should be evaluated by requiring participants to first collect data from the environment, to see how usable they are in situations where information is not readily available. 

\section{Limitations and Future work}
Limitations which are particular to studies have been discussed in previous chapters, but here I discuss a number of limitations that concern all studies. 

My work opens up areas for future research. First, the browser notification was simple in design. The aim of the last two studies was to test the effect of time feedback on duration of interruptions and task performance, rather than studying people’s engagement with it over time. Future work would be to further refine the implementation and 

\subsection{Complementing with other solutions}
One area to explore further is how the tool presented in this thesis can be combined and complemented by other approaches. Prior work has looked at different approaches to reduce disruptiveness by blocking interruptions and giving reflective information. In Chapter 5 the limitations of these interventions have been discussed. The browser notification in my study addressed these: The browser notification in my study specifically gave information on the duration of their interruptions, as this was found to be an important deciding factor in people’s self-interruption behaviour. It would be interesting to explore how different interventions could be combined and complement each other. For example, In Study 7 one effect of the browser notification was that it made people reflect on their actions during interruptions. The browser notification may work as an initial trigger, but could be complemented with a more extensive back log such as those provided by RescueTime and ManicTime, so people are able to investigate what they were doing during an interruption, and why some interruptions may be longer than others. Prior work has shown that a barrier for people to currently engage with it is that it is not clear what to do with the extensive data and that it lacks context. Future work would need to investigate whether giving people a trigger may help as an entry point to better understand and use the data. 

\subsection{Predicting the type of interruption to advise length of interruption}
Not all self-interruptions are equally bad: prior work has investigated the timing, relevance, and workload of an interruption on task performance. This thesis has mainly focused on the duration of an interruption, as this was found to be an important deciding factor in people's decisions when and whether to self-interrupt. Furthermore, the longer people interrupt, the more disruptive it can be, and a longer duration can indicate that people are getting distracted. However, as became apparent in Study 7, sometimes people need to make a long interruption. In these cases, the duration may not be informative about whether people are getting distracted or not, and may not be useful as people are limited in their ability to shorten the duration of these interruptions. Future work could investigate people's actions during an interruption, to see whether people are making a necessary and useful interruption, or whether they are getting distracted. One aspect could be people's interactions during an interruption. For example, the browser extension DataSelfie\footnote{https://dataselfie.it/} tracks users' interactions when switching to Facebook to try and predict what the user is doing: are they actively looking something up to return to their work, or are they browsing through feeds? This information may get used to advise people on an appropriate time length, and give them timely reminders to return to a task. 

Looking at the source people switch to is not sufficient, as people switch to distracting sources both for work and leisure.

\subsection{Tracking behaviour over time}
Lastly, further work is needed to determine how people engage with time feedback over time. This thesis ended with two formative studies exploring the use of a browser notification for about 15 minutes in Study 6, and one working week during Study 7. Though the results are promising, a remaining question is whether people would continue to engage with the notification over time, as many personal informatics tools get abandoned (source). 

Furthermore, the notification only gave feedback on people’s current interruption behaviour. Some participants in Study 7 commented that they would like to see an overview of all interruptions, to see whether the actions they are taking has any considerable effect, and not just on their interruptions at that moment.

\subsection{Implementation of feedback}
In its current implementation, the notification was evaluated using browser-based work, and intended for managing switching windows on this same device. People increasingly use multiple devices and may switch between devices to look up information on their phone or tablet. It would be easy to imagine to extend the notification across devices and take into account cross-device actions, which can show people a notification on a new device they switch to. Furthermore, it may be implemented as a standalone application to provide interruption information when doing a task in a non-browser computer window, such as when writing a document in a word processor.

\subsection{Studying information interruptions in other settings}
The type of task studied throughout this thesis revolved around a main data entry interface and was characterised by switching frequently and, usually, for short amounts of time. As such, information seeking was considered as a subtask to support the primary task and not analysed as a task in itself. In other domains and types of work, the balance may be different: law and journalism have to spend a large proportion of their time seeking information (source), and may spend approximately equal amounts of time in several different computer windows. 

Furthermore, a large part may be re-finding previously used information. One design idea briefly discussed in Chapter 5 was to make it easier to collect and keep information nearby, reducing the duration of interruptions. As data entry work often requires new information, this idea was not developed further in this thesis, but it could be worthwhile to study for other tasks. 

\subsection{Limitations}
In this thesis, I focused on a particular type of work in a specific setting: data entry work in financial administration offices. What was interesting about this type of work is that interruptions can be especially disruptive as they increase errors, but at the same time it is a type of task where interruptions are necessary. This task characteristic is not unique for data entry work in offices in particular, and there many types of computer-based tasks that involve frequent switching between computer windows \citep{Czerwinski2004}. I expect the results to generalise to desktop-based work, where the user does not know which information is needed and has to make frequent and short switches. Examples are …. Other types of computer tasks may involve retrieving information as well, but information is either needed for a longer period of time, or people are able to collect these beforehand: for these tasks, the results of the thesis may not extend. As discussed in the Future work section, it would be worthwhile to explore inquiries in these different domains. 

This thesis used a mixed method approach, in order to study observed real-world phenomena in a controlled setting. Based on observational findings of Study 2, I made the hypothesis that people postpone inquiries because of time costs, which I tested through a series of controlled experiments. However, a limitation of experiments is that by converting a qualitative finding into a quantitative variable and controlling for other possible confounds, there is a disadvantage in it not accurately reflecting the actual phenomenon observed. While the independent variable may not be exactly as situated in office work, the observed findings in Chapter 4 are supported by existing literature and findings from the studies in Chapter 3. Overall, the findings were consistent across qualitative and quantitative studies. [Todo: concluding sentence, refer to literature on mixed methods]

%Furthermore, there were limitations in gathering sufficient quantitative data in the qualitative studies (Study 1, 2, 6), and a large part of the data in these studies is based on self-reports from participants, and observational data from the researcher. quantitative data in the experiments largely corroborates the qualitative findings,  but these different types of data are drawn from different participants doing similar, but not the same work.  The results from the different studies were consistent and quantitative and qualitative data complemented each other in understanding how time costs has an effect on task performance, self-interruption behaviour, as well as people’s subjective experience.

Furthermore, participants were drawn from different populations: the participants in Study 1, 2, and 7 were office workers, while participants in 3-6 were from various backgrounds. The reason for not exclusively recruiting office workers for the experiments as well was that to make significant claims on the effect of time costs and time feedback on people’s strategies, it was important to have a sufficient sample size. Office workers have busy work schedules and were hard to recruit, which is also reflected in the small sample size for the qualitative studies. Participation for the experimental studies was therefore opened up to other participants as well. Participation was limited to office workers in the remaining studies: it was essential to recruit office workers in Study 1 and 2, to get a detailed understanding of how data entry work is situated in an office context. Furthermore, it was important to recruit office workers in Study 7, to get an understanding how appropriate the developed intervention would be in this context. [Todo: concluding sentence,  refer to literature on participant generalisability]

%Practical implication. Prior work on self-interruption management has mostly considered self-interruptions which are not necessary, and thus can be controlled by users if they are given the right tools to self-regulate. The results in this thesis suggest that these existing approaches to interruption management are insufficient and inappropriate for necessary, task-related interruptions. 

\subsection{Conclusion}
Many computer-based tasks require users to interrupt themselves to collect information, which can lead to distractions, and it is challenging to remain focused on the primary task. Prior research has shown that the longer an interruption, the slower people are to resume and the higher likelihood of errors being made. The work in this thesis shows that presumed time effort affects how people address inquiries: they address interruptions immediately if they except them to be short. The implication of this is that people may make many interruptions they think they can return from quickly - even if these end up being far longer than intended.

This thesis has also shown how making it explicit to people how long they actually go away from a task can help in managing self-interruptions: making people aware triggers them to reflect on what they are doing during these interruptions, and makes them reduce the length of interruptions. This is an important finding which has implications for the design of interruption management and productivity tools. It opens up a lot of interesting questions which would be worthwhile to address in future work. 

My work makes an important contribution to interruptions literature. By demonstrating that time effort influences people’s self-interruption behaviour, it highlights the need to make people more aware of when they are making interruptions and for how long. My findings extend our understanding of the factors impacting how people manage self-interruptions . Even though I focused on a particular type of interruption triggered to look up information.
