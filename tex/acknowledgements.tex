First of all, many thanks go to my supervisors Duncan and Anna. Duncan for bouncing off ideas with, challenging me on why I’m doing things the way I do, and Anna for questioning how these things contribute to the big picture. But most of all, thanks for being accessible and available at all times. 

Thanks to Ann Blandford for examining my first-year and upgrade vivas. The feedback was critical in shaping this thesis.

Thanks to everyone at UCLIC - while a PhD can feel lonely at times, being able to talk to others over coffee, beers and afternoon walks helped a lot, and I'll miss the daily lunches, chats, and laughs. Thanks to Sarah and Sandy for all their helpful advice when I got started, and for sharing my enthusiasm about data entry and interruptions - which admittedly is a niche thing to get excited about.
Thanks to Louise for always helping out with various things and making sure everything runs smoothly.
Thank you to all academics I had the opportunity to work with on the MSc course, for teaching me about teaching.

During the last part of my PhD, I was fortunate to work at Microsoft Research. Having a break from my PhD, and being able to collaborate with inspiring researchers, helped me go back to my PhD research with a fresh and refocused look to improve the quality of my work. In particular thanks to my mentors Kenton and Andy for always challenging and encouraging me to improve. 

I would also like to thank my MSc supervisor Paul Cairns: my master’s project back in 2013 was the catalyst that inspired me to pursue a PhD in data entry at UCL. 

The studies in this thesis depended on participants, and I am very grateful for everyone who has taken part. 

Thanks to my friends for a listening ear and being understanding regarding my erratic work schedule - I’m sorry for all the events I’ve had to miss last-minute!

Finally, thanks to my family, who may not always have understood what I was up to exactly all these past years, but supported me nonetheless.
