abstract = {Although remanufacturing can be both profitable and less harmful to the environment than traditional manufacturing, its uptake is still limited. Previous research shows that this limitation could be the consequence of poor definition of remanufacturing and confusion with terms like second-hand or refurbished products. Other research claims that this downturn is due to the fact that OEMs are not actively engaged in remanufacturing and therefore the products are not designed for remanufacture; inadvertently increasing the cost of remanufacturing. To make the remanufacturing oriented design, it is important to have effective flow of communication across the supply chain with the help of virtual engineering tools. This research investigates the model based virtual engineering approach in the search for a unique solution that would foster the growth of remanufacturing. {\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

abstract = {In everyday life, we often use external artefacts such as diaries to help us remember intended behaviours. In addition, we commonly manipulate our environment, for example by placing reminders in noticeable places. Yet strategic offloading of intentions to the external environment is not typically permitted in laboratory tasks examining memory for delayed intentions. What factors influence our use of such strategies, and what behavioural consequences do they have? This article describes four online experiments (N = 1196) examining a novel web-based task in which participants hold intentions for brief periods, with the option to strategically externalize these intentions by creating a reminder. This task significantly predicted participants' fulfilment of a naturalistic intention embedded within their everyday activities up to one week later (with greater predictive ability than more traditional prospective memory tasks, albeit with weak effect size). Setting external reminders improved performance, and it was more prevalent in older adults. Furthermore, participants set reminders adaptively, based on (a) memory load, and (b) the likelihood of distraction. These results suggest the importance of metacognitive processes in triggering intention offloading, which can increase the probability that intentions are eventually fulfilled.},

annote = {Conflicting ideas on interruptions
[8]: interruptions might be beneficial
[1,3]: interruptions are detrimental
[10]: interruptions of same context current task beneficial, interruptions of different context disruptive

RQ1: what is the influence of interruption context on disruption cost?

RQ2: how does interrupted work change state user; stressful, more effortful than noninterrupted work?

RQ3: are disruption costs mitigated by personality factors?

Disruption cost: 
- same context might be beneficial
- same context might interfer with primary task
- context may not matter

Experiment
IV: interruption context (no interruption, same context, different context)
media type (telephone, IM)
lab setting, simulated office
primary task: email task answering questions
secondary task: questions supervisor (experimenter) 

DV: 
- task completion time (primary task, interruptions)
- politeness metric
- subjective workload
- personality measures

Results
- subjects took longest time in baseline condition
- no difference on time in media
- no difference in errors on interruption types
- no difference in politeness across onditions
- email messages longest in B condition (that's why they took longer)
- no difference in interruption length across conditions
- the higher one scores on 'openness to experience' and 'need for personal structure', the quicker it takes to complete an interrupted task

workload
- workload highest for D
- stess highest for S and D
- level of frustration highest for S and D
- highest time pressure for S and D
- most effort reported for S and D

Take-away messages:
- interruptions of same context may be perceived as beneficial, but in reality is just as disruptive as interruptions of different context
- when people interrupted, work faster to compensate, but comes at a price that they experience higher level of workload/stress
={\textgreater} interruptions might only take extra time right after resumption, but that people make up for this by working faster},

abstract = {We investigated people's ability to decide how much time to spend on the task at hand. To make such decisions well, one must take into account, among other things, the cost of failing and how one's task performance changes as a function of time. We first investigated timing decisions when the underlying task was perceptual. Decisions were highly efficient and suggested that people can make good use of perceptual knowledge and abstract reward information. Previous studies have found that perceptual decisions are generally optimal, but that cognitive decisions are generally suboptimal—a perception-cognition gap. Does a similar gap exist for timing decisions? We compared timing decisions for a perceptual task with timing decisions for more cognitive tasks. Performance was highly similar across the tasks, which suggests that knowledge can be acquired, and used to make timing decisions, in an equally efficient way regardless of whether that knowledge is derived through perceptual or cognitive experience.},

The time-based word length effect refers to this finding when the lists comprise items that vary only in pronunciation time. Three experiments compared recall of three different sets of disyllabic words that differed systematically only in spoken duration. One set showed a word length effect, one set showed no effect of word length, and the third showed a reverse word length effect, with long words recalled better than short. A new fourth set of words was created, and it also failed to yield a time-based word length effect. Because all four experiments used the same methodologyand varied only the stimulus sets, it is argued that the time-based word length effect is not robust and as such poses problems for models based on the phonological loop.},

@article{Kawado2003,
abstract = {Data entry and its verification are important steps in the process of data management in clinical studies. In Japan, a kind of visual comparison called the reading aloud (RA) method is often used as an alternative to or in addition to the double data entry (DDE) method. In a typical RA method, one operator reads previously keyed data aloud while looking at a printed sheet or computer screen, and another operator compares the voice with the corresponding data recorded on case report forms (CRFs) to confirm whether the data are the same. We compared the efficiency of the RA method with that of the DDE method in the data management system of the Japanese Registry of Renal Transplantation. Efficiency was evaluated in terms of error detection rate and expended time. Five hundred sixty CRFs were randomly allocated to two operators for single data entry. Two types of DDE and RA methods were performed. Single data entry errors were detected in 358 of 104,720 fields (per-field error rate = 0.34{\%}). Error detection rates were 88.3{\%} for the DDE method performed by a different operator, 69.0{\%} for the DDE method performed by the same operator, 59.5{\%} for the RA method performed by a different operator, and 39.9{\%} for the RA method performed by the same operator. The differences in these rates were significant (p{\textless}0.001) between the two verification methods as well as between the types of operator (same or different). The total expended times were 74.8 hours for the DDE method and 57.9 hours for the RA method. These results suggest that in detecting errors of single data entry, the RA method is inferior to the DDE method, while its time cost is lower. ?? 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In the study of numerical and arithmetical abilities, there is compelling evidence demonstrating that number and space representations are connected to one another. Historically the first source of support came more than a century ago, when Galton's investigations on mental imagery suggested that the internal representation of numbers may evoke a stable, linear space. In the past few decades, empirical evidence lent further support to the hypothesis that numerical representation is spatially coded into a non-verbal 'mental number line', which in turn lead to considering this representation as the core of number meaning. Visuo-spatial processing is intuitively involved in various aspects of number processing and calculation: For instance, the meaning of a digit in a multi-digit number is coded following spatial information, given its association to its relative position within the number; similarly, to solve a complex written multiplication one has to know the correct location of the intermediate results. In this review behavioral, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging data concerning the close relationship between numerical abilities and visuo-spatial processes are considered.},

These constraints are formulated algebraically and tested through simulation of latency and error data from the Tower of Hanoi, a means-ends puzzle that depends heavily on suspension and resumption of goals.

Much previous research on technostress has focused on the use of digital technology and its effects, measured by questionnaires, but in order to further examine how technostress arises in the modern workplace, a wider perspective on interactions between people and technology is needed. This paper applies a distributed cognition perspective to human–technology interaction, investigated through an observational field study. Distributed cognition focuses on the organisation of cognitive systems, and technostress in this perspective becomes an emergent phenomenon within a complex and dynamic socio-technical system. A well-established questionnaire was also used (for a limited sample), to gain a frame of reference for the results from the qualitative part of the study. The implications are that common questionnaire-based approaches very well can and should be complemented with a broader perspective to study causes of technostress. Based on the present study, a redefinition of technostress is also proposed.},

Prior work patterns based on paper, verbal exchange, and manual methods are replaced with automated, computerized, and potentially less flexible systems. The objective of this study is to explore the information management strategies that clinicians use in the process of adapting to a CPOE system using cognitive task analysis techniques. Design: Observation and semi-structured interviews were conducted with 88 primary-care clinicians at 10 Veterans Administration Medical Centers. Measurements: Interviews were taped, transcribed, and extensively analyzed to identify key information management goals, strategies, and tasks. Tasks were aggregated into groups, common components across tasks were clarified, and underlying goals and strategies identified. Results: Nearly half of the identified tasks were not fully supported by the available technology. Six core components of tasks were identified. Four meta-cognitive information management goals emerged: 1) Relevance Screening; 2) Ensuring Accuracy; 3) Minimizing memory load; and 4) Negotiating Responsibility. Strategies used to support these goals are presented. Conclusion: Users develop a wide array of information management strategies that allow them to successfully adapt to new technology.

2 tasks
Task 1: mail task, memorise product information in email and switch to browser to look up price; then return to email and reply with answer
Task 2: at random moments chat message, participants could switch whenever they wanted

IV
delay/no delay after every link
={\textgreater} after link 1 or 2 information still has to be held in memory, so better to not switch
={\textgreater} after link 3, nothing in working memory so good moment to switch
difficulty questions chat (easy/difficult)
={\textgreater} easy were yes/no, difficult were open-ended

delay when searching for price: creates a clear low-workload moment in middle of the task
3 s delay when switching to email window

Results
- more switches on high workload in delay condition
- spent more time on each mail in delay condition
- switched at delays at link 1 and link 2 in delay condition, but lost sign. more time (2.3 s) overall than that they gained (0.5 s)
- participants were sign. slower when they forgot the information and had to go back to check

Take-aways:
- delay in primary task strong trigger for switching to secondary task
- switch as soon as resources available},

For ex-ample, it may be hard to subjectively rank a large set of pho-tographs, but easy to sort them in spare moments by making many pairwise comparisons. In crowdsourcing systems, mi-crotasking enables unskilled workers with limited commit-ment to work together to complete tasks they would not be able to do individually. We explore the costs and benefits of decomposing macrotasks into microtasks for three task cat-egories: arithmetic, sorting, and transcription. We find that breaking these tasks into microtasks results in longer over-all task completion times, but higher quality outcomes and a better experience that may be more resilient to interruptions. These results suggest that microtasks can help people com-plete high quality work in interruption-driven environments.},

annote = {- examines how people with a lot of display space arrange information
Main findings
People using two screens usually use the second screen for secondary activities related to the primary task, for peripheral awareness of information not currently primary focus, and easy access to resources
- second monitor improves efficiency, but in ways that are difficult to measure
- we use more and more applications and devices, but information overload is a concern; we need to organise this ourselves
drawbacks multiple screens: take up more desk space, do not connect seamlessly
benefits: forces people to think about positioning of windows; can be less distracting? people's focus on one screen
- people rarely see second monitor as ‘additional space'; maximise on one screen and only use second screen for additional activities; more about partitioning than increasing space
={\textgreater} there is no information on palmtop that is not available on desktop: value is in having instant access to resource in known location in peripheral vision
={\textgreater} benefit is not in small increment of space, but partition: space had dedicated purpose
- sometimes second monitor used to copy material from one object into another, but almost always used for secondary purposes
- second screen used for notifications; focus not there so less disruptive, but can still glance at them; software cannot easily deduce where we are working and when we can be interrupted; multiple monitors allows users more control of interrupts by positioning them
- clicking button, tabbing to see something is perceived as way more disruptive than switching visual attention to second screen (but difficult to measure actual efficiency)
={\textgreater} sometimes finding right minimised window or certain item much more time-consuming than visually scanning the full set of information
- reduces cognitive load by allowing rapid glances to check on information: ‘can just read and go to line, instead of reading it, alt-tabbing, maybe forgetting it and getting distracted in the process'
- most applications have given no thought on how to appear on dual monitors
- uses analogy house: one large room not the same as multiple rooms; can use one as bedroom, one as living room ={\textgreater} ‘the wall makes a difference'; forces people to divide and partition windows into different windows depending on task
- large display: useful for shared work
- a place will reamin for arbitrary division of space provided by multiple monitors

Design
- there are some things we want brought to our attention, but others should be kept in periphery
={\textgreater} multiple monitors could allow notifications and help etc. to be kept on second screen
- flipping back and forth makes you lose train of thought},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The aims of this study were to investigate how a variety of research methods is commonly employed to study technology and practitioner cognition. User-interface issues with infusion pumps were selected as a case because of its relevance to patient safety.

METHODS: Starting from a Cognitive Systems Engineering perspective, we developed an Impact Flow Diagram showing the relationship of computer technology, cognition, practitioner behavior, and system failure in the area of medical infusion devices. We subsequently conducted a systematic literature review on user-interface issues with infusion pumps, categorized the studies in terms of methods employed, and noted the usability problems found with particular methods. Next, we assigned usability problems and related methods to the levels in the Impact Flow Diagram.

RESULTS: Most study methods used to find user interface issues with infusion pumps focused on observable behavior rather than on how artifacts shape cognition and collaboration. A concerted and theory-driven application of these methods when testing infusion pumps is lacking in the literature. Detailed analysis of one case study provided an illustration of how to apply the Impact Flow Diagram, as well as how the scope of analysis may be broadened to include organizational and regulatory factors.

CONCLUSION: Research methods to uncover use problems with technology may be used in many ways, with many different foci. We advocate the adoption of an Impact Flow Diagram perspective rather than merely focusing on usability issues in isolation. Truly advancing patient safety requires the systematic adoption of a systems perspective viewing people and technology as an ensemble, also in the design of medical device technology.},

abstract = {We are quickly passing through the historical moment when people work in front of a single computer, dominated by a small CRT and focused on tasks involving only local information. Networked computers are becoming ubiquitous and are playing increasingly significant roles in our lives and in the basic infrastructures of science, business, and social interaction. For human-computer interaction to advance in the new millennium we need to better understand the emerging dynamic of interaction in which the focus task is no longer confined to the desktop but reaches into a complex networked world of information and computer-mediated interactions. We think the theory of distributed cognition has a special role to play in understanding interactions between people and technologies, for its focus has always been on whole environments: what we really do in them and how we coordinate our activity in them. Distributed cognition provides a radical reorientation of how to think about designing and supporting human-computer interaction. As a theory it is specifically tailored to understanding interactions among people and technologies. In this article we propose distributed cognition as a new foundation for human-computer interaction, sketch an integrated research framework, and use selections from our earlier work to suggest how this framework can provide new opportunities in the design of digital work materials.},

These phenomena are important, it is argued, because they challenge some particular cognitive models. However, we reject those views, influential in the HCI literature, that phenomena like these require radically new conceptions of cognition or behaviour. It is shown that the phenomena are not universal laws of behaviour, but that instead people decide how much to remember and how much to plan according to a consideration of the costs and benefits of different strategies. Thus the classical cognitive conception of humans as adaptive decision makers is vital for a deep understanding of HCI.},

abstract = {We tested how non-experts judge point probability for seven different visual representations of uncertainty, using a case from an unfamiliar domain. Participants (n=140) rated the probability that the boundary between two earth layers passed through a given point, for seven different visualizations of the positional uncertainty of the boundary. For all types of visualizations, most observers appear to construct an internal model of the uncertainty distribution that closely resembles a normal distribution. However, the visual form of the uncertainty range (i.e., the visualization type) affects this internal model and the internal model relates to participants' numeracy. We conclude that perceived certainty is affected by its visual representation. In a follow-up experiment we found no indications that the absence (or presence) of a prominent center line in the visualization affects the internal model. We discuss if and how our results inform which visual representation is most suitable for representing uncertainty and make suggestions for future work.},

Within this framework the primary objective is the development of a model that is sufficiently detailed to serve as a basis for explaining the number-processing/calculation performance of both normal and cognitively impaired subjects. First a general model of the cognitive mechanisms for number processing and calculation is outlined. It is shown that patterns of impairments observed in brain-damaged patients support the major assumptions of the model and that the model provides a theoretically motivated framework for interpreting the deficits. A single case is then discussed in some detail, to demonstrate that through detailed analyses of impaired performance the preliminary model can be elaborated to specify not only the general architecture of the number-processing and calculation systems, but also the inner workings of specific components and the consequences of damage to these components. The article concludes with a discussion of several general issues arising from the presented arguments.},

abstract = {The authors assume that individuals adapt rationally to a utility function given constraints imposed by their cognitive architecture and the local task environment. This assumption underlies a new approach to modeling and understanding cognition-cognitively bounded rational analysis-that sharpens the predictive acuity of general, integrated theories of cognition and action. Such theories provide the necessary computational means to explain the flexible nature of human behavior but in doing so introduce extreme degrees of freedom in accounting for data. The new approach narrows the space of predicted behaviors through analysis of the payoff achieved by alternative strategies, rather than through fitting strategies and theoretical parameters to data. It extends and complements established approaches, including computational cognitive architectures, rational analysis, optimal motor control, bounded rationality, and signal detection theory. The authors illustrate the approach with a reanalysis of an existing account of psychological refractory period (PRP) dual-task performance and the development and analysis of a new theory of ordered dual-task responses. These analyses yield several novel results, including a new understanding of the role of strategic variation in existing accounts of PRP and the first predictive, quantitative account showing how the details of ordered dual-task phenomena emerge from the rational control of a cognitive system subject to the combined constraints of internal variance, motor interference, and a response selection bottleneck.},

abstract = {Number entry is ubiquitous: it is required in many fields including science, healthcare, education, government, mathematics and finance. People entering numbers are to be expected to make errors, but shockingly few systems make any effort to detect, block or otherwise manage errors. Worse, errors may be ignored but processed in arbitrary ways, with unintended results. A standard class of error (defined in the paper) is an out by 10 error, which is easily made by miskeying a decimal point or a zero. In safety-critical domains, such as drug delivery, out by 10 errors generally have adverse consequences. Here, we expose the extent of the problem of numeric errors in a very wide range of systems. An analysis of better error management is presented: under reasonable assumptions, we show that the probability of out by 10 errors can be halved by better user interface design. We provide a demonstration user interface to show that the approach is practical. To kill an error is as good a service as, and sometimes even better than, the establishing of a new truth or fact.

abstract = {Recent developments in technology have meant that operators of complex systems, such as those found in the modern aircraft cockpit, now have access to an unprecedented volume of information. Significant focus within computer science and engineering has therefore been placed upon developing methods by which task-relevant information can be made as accessible as possible within the interface, thus reducing operator workload—a goal of traditional human factors approaches to interface design. Recent theoretical perspectives of adaptive human cognition [Gray, W.D. and Fu, W.-T. (2004). Soft constraints in interactive behaviour: the case of ignoring perfect knowledge in the world for imperfect knowledge in the head. Cogn. Sci., 28, 359–383] suggest that there is a delicate balance and a series of trade-offs between information access at the interface and resulting human interactive behaviour. A distinction has been drawn between display- and memory-based strategies. Two experiments are reported that investigated the relationship between information access and the selection of cognitive strategy, particularly the effect on learning and memory. Experiment 1 varied the cost of accessing information in a routine copying task, and found that higher access costs (e.g. mouse movement plus 1-s delay) led to the adoption of a memory-based strategy, and better retention of visual-spatial information. Experiment 2 manipulated the availability of fused information in a low-fidelity flight simulation task. Temporarily removing onscreen information similarly improved recall of site location information. The potential benefits are discussed of a novel approach to display design that manipulates information access depending on task performance criteria.},

It is notoriously difficult to provoke (and hence study) slips under experimental conditions. In this paper, the authors present an experimental task paradigm that has been shown to be effective for studying PCEs in routine procedural tasks. Two studies were carried out to examine the effect of interruption position and task structure on the prevalence of PCEs. It was found that significantly more PCEs were obtained when an interruption occurred just before the PC step than when an interruption occurred at any other position in the task. The authors account for this effect in terms of Altmann and Trafton's activation-based goal memory model. The same interruption effect was obtained for some, but not all, other procedural errors; the authors discuss the nature of these errors and likely explanations for the differences.},

To empirically validate why unnecessarily interrupting a user's task should be avoided, we designed an experiment measuring the effects of an interruption on a user's task performance, annoyance, and anxiety. Fifty subjects participated in the experiment. The results demonstrate that an interruption has a disruptive effect on both a user's task performance and emotional state, and that the degree of disruption depends on the user's mental load at the point of interruption. We discuss the implications of these results in terms of building a system to better coordinate interactions between the user and applications competing for that user's attention.},

@article{OHara2002,
abstract = {Writing research has typically focussed on the text production elements of writing. Many everyday writing tasks, however, cannot be characterized simply in terms of text production since they often involve the use of source materials to support the composition process. As such, these tasks are better thought of as hybrid tasks. Such hybrid tasks have been given relatively little attention in the literature and what little work has been done has taken a purely cognitive approach that downplays the material context within which the task takes place. Following Haas' critique of mainstream writing research which advocated the need to consider the material tools and artefacts in theories of writing, this paper takes a similar approach in relation to the hybrid tasks of writing while reading from multiple sources. A study is presented that explores a range of everyday writing from multiple sources in their real-world contexts. The study highlights a number of important characteristics of the interaction with the material artefacts used during these tasks and the impact that these have on the underlying cognitive processes. The hope is that these will begin to offer some grounding on which future theoretical understanding of these hybrid tasks can build, as well as providing useful insights into the design of technologies to support these tasks. {\#} The support of writing activities has been an impetus for many important technological developments over the years including most notably, word processors, hypertext 1071-5819/02/{\$} -see frontmatter {\#} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. authoring tools and collaborative writing environments. While these developments have had an important impact on writing behaviour, much of the focus for their design has been only on the text production elements of writing and the document being produced. For example, word processors are focussed primarily around the viewing and manipulation of the composition being produced as opposed to the viewing and manipulation of supporting source materials from which a writer might draw information and ideas. However, if we consider many everyday activities that we call writing, it is clear that they cannot be characterized just in terms of the text being produced. In a study of economists at the IMF, for instance, Sellen and Harper (1997) showed that while composing new policy documents, economists would spend almost 90{\%} of the time reading and referring to other documents while writing. Likewise, in a more specific study of work-related reading and writing across a range of different professions, a significant proportion of people's document work was found to involve reading source materials during text composition (Adler Gujar, Harrison, O'Hara {\&} Sellen, 1998). These kinds of activities, then, are better thought of as hybrid tasks in which there is a need to read, comprehend, synthesize and integrate information from multiple source documents during the generation of new compositions (Spivey {\&} King, 1989). By acknowledging the hybrid nature of many everyday writing activities, we begin to open up interesting new directions for developing technologies that further support everyday writing. In order to identify what these directions might be, it is first necessary to gain a greater understanding of these hybrid tasks. In particular, there is a need to more fully explicate the role of interacting with reference and source materials while writing in shaping the planning and generation of text. This paper presents our initial attempts to further our understanding in this domain through a study of real-world writing from multiple sources, across a range of different professions.},

Motivation
- interaction differences between implementations of number entry systems in infusion pumps
- aim not to eliminate all such differences, but rather to expose issues and deepen understanding of the situation

Differential Formal Analysis
1. Stochastic Key Slip Simulation
- generate large number of key sequences, insert keying error with probability p per keystroke
- if actual and intended result differs by more than a certain magnitude k, count the error
- proposed designs evaluated for consequences of such slips
2. setters, solvers, slip models
- solver: takes two numbers (m,n) and generates sequence of key presses to change display from m to n
- slip model: inserts slips (substitution, repetition, omission, transposition) 
- setter: executes key sequences
3. error sensitivity
- given a design d, experiment calculates results of running a solver, slip model and setter on various (m,n) pairs
- divide nr of paths that lead to out-by-ten error/total nr of paths

Implementation variations 
- wraparound: if max. value and up digit, back to min value; if leftmost and left digit, back to rightmost position and vice versa
- arithmetic: if 09 and up, goes to 10
- cursor start position: whether on left or right
- block errors: some alert users when something done wrong (e.g. attempting to move beyond bounds display if no wraparound)

Issues
- unsure which paths users take to enter numbers
- how features behave at boundaries

Most improvement design (from most to least)
Block errors, left start, cursor wraparound, arithmetic, vertical wraparound

Case study Braunomat
- left-to-right strategy admits less out-by-ten errors
- error blocking reducing nr of errors

Conclusion
- design choices in 5-key number entry interface influences sensitivity to error
- attempt to block user error},

Interruptions averaging 4.4 s long tripled the rate of sequence errors on post-interruption trials relative to baseline trials. Interruptions averaging 2.8 s long--about the time to perform a step in the interrupted task--doubled the rate of sequence errors. Nonsequence errors showed no interruption effects, suggesting that global attentional processes were not disrupted. Response latencies showed smaller interruption effects than sequence errors, a difference we interpret in terms of high levels of interference generated by the primary task. The results are consistent with an account in which activation spreading from the focus of attention allows control processes to navigate task-relevant representations and in which momentary interruptions are disruptive because they shift the focus and thereby cut off the flow.},

1. planning: 'process of organizing action steps required for number entry (i.e. viewing numbers and remembering them in short-term memory)'
2. acting: 'process of performing these steps (i.e. interacting with the UI)'

Gap:
previous studies show that numeric attributes can affect the way users view and mentally process numbers; but not clear how these factors influence the bigger picture of number entry performance at level of planning and acting

Previous work
1. UI design: entry interface
- key shape/size/layout
- incr. vs. serial
- handwriting/gesture input
2. numeric representation
- effects of number length and digit-grouping on immediate recall
- frequency numbers
- syntactic/visual aspects
={\textgreater} provide useful guidelines to improve number entry performance, but little attention has been paid to examing number-related factors on user performance

Experiment
- touch screen numeric keypad
- IV: key size (small/medium/large), distance/IAC (target was near or far away), number type (integer/decimal) number length (short/long)
- DV: corrected errors, uncorrected errors, entry time
- within-subjects design
- 48 randomly generated numbers 
- practice: 6 numbers for each condition
- asked to use index finger of dominant hand 
- as accurately {\&} fast as possible
- corrected errors: if DEL key used during entry sequence

Results
- 61 uncorrected errors; long numbers correlated with more errors than short numbers (no effect position, number type, key size)
- 294 corrected errors; more errors higher number length, key size, decimal number type (no effect position)
1. Inititation time: release start button until contact first digit key
- sign. longer time decimal number type, long number length, far position, small key size
2. Interval time: release current digit and contact next digit/decimal key
- sign. effect number type, length, position, keysize (longer time for small key size)
3. Commit time: release last digit key until release enter button
- sign. effect longer number length, small key size

Discussion
- corrected errors increase with longer number length 
- long numbers also more uncorrected errors
={\textgreater} emphasises importance chunking
- decimal type numbers more corrected errors
={\textgreater} DP may affect way people view and mentally process numbers, may use it as delimiter, may miss it
- IAC effect on time, but not accuracy
- longer duration between keystrokes for longer numbers, decimal type and far position:
={\textgreater} more extensive planning of motor sequences (e.g. chunking) as well as visual search and movement
- planning time in initiation step and checking time: longer with longer numbers
={\textgreater} may not dedicate this time in work-intensive environments; interface design should encourage users to spend more time and pay more attention in these phases
- keys with side length of 12.15 mm large enough

Text vs number entry
- difficult to build predictive correction model like text entry because number entry errors more ambiguous
Wobbrock {\&} Myers (2006): errors in text entry
- text entry: words are stored in long-term memory
- number entry: instruction numbers have to be rememberd in short-term memory
={\textgreater} users adopt different strategies for processing numbers and text, such as grouping digits},

abstract = {The aim of this paper was to investigate whether it was possible to induce more internal planning in the four-disk Tower of Hanoi (ToH) in order not only to produce more efficient problem solving but also to make it more resistant to the negative effect of interruption. The theoretical frameworks of soft constraints and the memory for goals model underpinned Experiments 1 and 2. In both experiments, three goal-state access cost conditions were used: high (mouse movements and 2.5-s delay), medium (mouse movements) and low (goal state always available). In Experiment 1, more memory-based planning was induced by the high cost condition, which resulted in fewer moves to solution and the gradual development of an efficient subgoaling strategy, resulting in more perfect solutions. In Experiment 2, the same condition protected performance against a 10-s interruption irrespective of the interrupting task (blank screen, mental arithmetic, or three-disk ToH). The more memory-based planning strategy, induced by high access cost, presumably strengthened participants' goals during planning and problem solving, making them less susceptible to decay and interference from interruption. These novel results are discussed in the context of other recent studies.},
annote = {aim: investigate whether increasing IAC leads to more internal planning; not only for more efficient problem solving but also making it more resistant to interruptions

corroboratory evidence for soft constraints, against views that aim to conserve cognitive effort

novel findings
- more efficient and did not come at any extra cost in terms of time, even when access costs included
- Exp2: high IAC resumed more interrupted trials from memory, and executed more moves after interruption before finishing or revisiting target window - no extra completion time as in Morgan et al. (2009)

in Waldron et al. (2011) app. 13 and 37 extra seconds per visit
in this study, only three extra seconds but still had effect on strategy

gap
extensive evidence in support of the
theory of soft constraints from tasks requiring a significant memory resource. However, less is known about the effect of increased access cost on problem solving and whether this will induce greater planning that, in turn, will increase problem-solving efficiency.

The present study uses the theoretical framework of the theory of soft constraints (Gray et al., 2006) and manipulation of the key factor in this theory—that is, increased time to access information (here the goal state)—to examine whether more memory- based planning can be induced in problem solving

Soft Constraints
Memory for Goals
- high IAC will lead to more internal planning ={\textgreater} will strengthen goal representation ={\textgreater} increase resistance against interruptions

Task
Tower of Hanoi
High IAC: mouse movements and 2.5 s delay
Medium: mouse movement
Low: always available

Exp1
H: increased access cost will increase both planning and efficiency
- high IAC more memory-based planning; fewer moves and learning of more efficient subgoaling strategy

Exp2
H: increased IAC will make it more resistent against interruptions
- high IAC protected performance against 10s- interruption

Motivation
- people are reluctant to use internal as opposed to external memory

Waldron et al. (2011)
- argue that cost to access information has more direct effect on planning than implementation costs
- participants engaged in more planning before action, but no improvement in problem-solving efficiency

Future work/limitations
1. assumption that people dislike delays so try to avoid them; possible that lockout time itself was used for planning, even though only current state was visible during this lockout.
={\textgreater} future work is to induce cogn. load in delays
2. effects confined to particular values of parameters used
={\textgreater} longer interruption duration may cause decay beyond a point at which even high IAC can help},

abstract = {Mobile devices are increasingly used for text-entry in contexts where visual attention is fragmented and graphical information is inadequate, yet the current solutions to typing on virtual keyboards make it a visually demanding task. This work looks at assistive technologies and interface attributes as tools to ease the task. Two within-subject experiments were performed with 23 and 17 participants, respectively. The first experiment aimed to understand how walking affected text-entry performance and additionally to assess how effective assistive technologies can be in mobile contexts. In the second experiment, adaptive keyboards featuring character prediction and pre-attentive attributes to ease visual demands of text-entry interfaces were developed and evaluated. It has been found that both text-input speed and overall quality are affected in mobile situations. Contrary to the expectations, assistive technologies proved ineffective with visual feedback. The second experiment showed that pre-attentive attributes do not affect users' performance in task-entry tasks, even though a 3.3–4.3 {\%} decrease in error rates was measured. It was found that users reduce walking speed to compensate for challenges placed by mobile text-entry. Caution should be exercised when transferring assistive technologies to mobile contexts, since they need adaptations to address mobile users' needs. Also, while pre-attentive attributes seemingly have no effect on experienced {\{}QWERTY{\}} typists' performance, they showed promise for both novice users and typists in attention-demanding contexts.},

In an experiment, users performed a mail-browser primary task while being occasionally interrupted by a secondary chat task, evenly distributed between points of higher and lower workload. Analysis showed that 94{\%} of the time, users switched to the interrupting task during periods of lower workload, versus only 6{\%} during periods of higher workload.

abstract = {Much research on modeling human performance associated with visual perception is formulated by schematic models based on neural mechanisms or cognitive architectures. But, these two modeling paradigms are limited in the domains of multiple monitor environments. Although the schematic model based on neural mechanisms can represent human visual systems in multiple monitor environments by providing a detailed account of eye and head movements, these models cannot easily be applied in complex cognitive interactions. On the other hand, the cognitive architectures can model the interaction of multiple aspects of cognition, but these architectures have not focused on modeling the visual orienting behavior of eye and head movements. Thus, in this study, a specific cognitive architecture, which is ACT-R, is extended by an existing schematic model of human visual systems based on neural mechanisms in order to model human performance in multiple monitor environments more accurately. And, this study proposes a method of modeling human performance using the extended ACT-R. The proposed method is validated by an experiment, confirming that the proposed method is able to predict human performance more accurately in multiple monitor environments. Relevance to industry: Predicting human performance with a computational model can be used as an alternative method to implementing iterative user testing for developing a system interface. The computational model in this study can predict human performance in multiple monitor environments, so that the model can be applied early on in the design phase, to evaluate the system interface in multiple monitor environments.},

This framework is explicitly cognitive $\backslash$nin that it is concerned with how information is represented and how representations are transformed and propagated in the performance of tasks.

abstract = {Keystroke logging has become instrumental in identifying writing strategies and understanding cognitive processes. Recent technological advances have refined logging efficiency and analytical outputs. While keystroke logging allows for ecological data collection, it is often difficult to connect the fine grain of logging data to the underlying cognitive processes. Multiple methodologies are useful to offset these difficulties. In this article we explore the complementarity of the keystroke logging program Inputlog with other observational techniques: thinking aloud protocols and eyetracking data. In addition, we illustrate new graphic and statistical data analysis techniques, mainly adapted from network analysis and data mining. Data extracts are drawn from a study of writing from multiple sources. In conclusion, we consider future developments for keystroke logging, in particular letter- to word-level aggregation and logging standardization. {\textcopyright} 2013 SAGE Publications.},

abstract = {Human data entry can result in errors that ruin statistical results and conclusions. A single data entry error can make a moderate correlation turn to zero and a significant t-test non-significant. Therefore, researchers should design and use human computer interactions that minimize data entry errors. In this paper, 195 undergraduates were randomly assigned to three data entry methods: double entry, visual checking, and single entry. After training in their assigned method, participants entered 30 data sheets, each containing six types of data. Visual checking resulted in 2958{\%} more errors than double entry, and was not significantly better than single entry. These data entry errors sometimes had terrible effects on coefficient alphas, correlations, and t-tests. For example, 66{\%} of the visual checking participants produced incorrect values for coefficient alpha, which was sometimes wrong by more than.40. Moreover, these data entry errors would be hard to detect: Only 0.06{\%} of the errors were blank or outside of the allowable range for the variables. Thus, researchers cannot rely upon histograms and frequency tables to detect data entry errors. Single entry and visual checking should be replaced with more effective data entry methods, such as double entry. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Multitasking is prevalent during computer-mediated work. Users tend to switch between multiple ongoing computer-based tasks either due to a personal decision to break from the current task (self-interruption) or due to an external interruption, such as an electronic notification. To examine how different types of multitasking, along with subjective task difficulty, influence performance, we conducted a controlled experiment using a custom-developed multitasking environment. A total of 636 subjects were randomly assigned into one of the three conditions: discretionary, where they were allowed to decide when and how often to switch tasks; mandatory, where they were forced to switch tasks at specific times; and sequential, where they had to perform tasks in sequence, without switching. The experimental environment featured a primary problem-solving task and five secondary tasks. The results show that when the primary task was considered difficult, subjects forced to multitask had significantly lower performance compared with not only the subjects who did not multitask but also the subjects who were able to multitask at their discretion. Conversely, when the primary task was considered easy, subjects forced to multitask had significantly higher performance than both the subjects who did not multitask and the subjects who multitasked at their discretion. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS • The study compares the effects of different types of multitasking and subjective task difficulty with an experiment. • It uses a custom-developed multitasking environment with three conditions. • Compares performance scores of mandatory, discretionary and no multitasking. • Those forced to multitask performed the worst when the task was deemed difficult. • However, when the task was deemed easy, those forced to multitask performed the best.},

Most previous studies on email have focused on management and retrieval behaviour within a single account and on a single device. In this paper, we examine how people retrieve email in today's ecosystem through an in-depth qualitative diary study with 16 participants. We found that personal and work accounts are managed differently, resulting in diverse retrieval strategies: while work accounts are more structured and thus email is retrieved through folders, personal accounts have fewer folders and users rely primarily on the built-in search option. Moreover, retrieval occurs primarily on laptops and PCs compared to smartphones. We explore the reasons, and uncover barriers and workarounds related to managing multiple accounts and devices. Finally, we consider new design possibilities for email clients to better support how email is used today.},

abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: We evaluate the short- and long-term effect of a computerized provider order entry-based patient verification intervention to reduce wrong-patient orders in 5 emergency departments.

METHODS: A patient verification dialog appeared at the beginning of each ordering session, requiring providers to confirm the patient's identity after a mandatory 2.5-second delay. Using the retract-and-reorder technique, we estimated the rate of wrong-patient orders before and after the implementation of the intervention to intercept these errors. We conducted a short- and long-term quasi-experimental study with both historical and parallel controls. We also measured the amount of time providers spent addressing the verification system, and reasons for discontinuing ordering sessions as a result of the intervention.

RESULTS: Wrong-patient orders were reduced by 30{\%} immediately after implementation of the intervention. This reduction persisted when inpatients were used as a parallel control. After 2 years, the rate of wrong-patient orders remained 24.8{\%} less than before intervention. The mean viewing time of the patient verification dialog was 4.2 seconds (SD=4.0 seconds) and was longer when providers indicated they placed the order for the wrong patient (4.9 versus 4.1 seconds). Although the display of each dialog took only seconds, the large number of display episodes triggered meant that the physician time to prevent each retract-and-reorder event was 1.5 hours.

CONCLUSION: A computerized provider order entry-based patient verification system led to a moderate reduction in wrong-patient orders that was sustained over time. Interception of wrong-patient orders at data entry is an important step in reducing these errors.},

The results of an experimental study suggest that alternative microstrategies can be deployed that shave milliseconds from routine interactive behavior. Data from a usability study are used to explore the potential of microstrategies for (a) bracketing the range of individual performance, (b) profiling individual differences, and (c) diagnosing mismatches between expected and obtained performance. These 2 studies support the arguments that the microstrategies deployed can be sensitive to small features of an interface and that task analyses at the millisecond level can inform design.},

abstract = {Errors in the execution of procedural tasks can have severe consequences. Attempts to ameliorate these slip errors through increased training and motivation have been shown to be ineffective. Instead, we identified the steps in a task procedure on which errors are most likely to occur, so that these might be designed out of the task procedure in the first place. Specifically, we considered whether device-oriented steps (i.e., steps in the task procedure that do not directly contribute to the achievement of the task goal) are more error-prone than task-oriented steps (i.e., steps that do directly contribute to the task goal). Two experiments are reported in which participants were trained to perform a novel procedural task. Across conditions, we manipulated the extent to which each step in the task procedure appeared to contribute to the achievement of the task goal (i.e., alternating the assignment of a task step between device- and task-oriented), while keeping the interface and underlying task procedure the same. Results show that participants made more errors and took longer to complete a task step when it played a device-oriented role rather than a task-orientated role. These effects were exacerbated by the introduction of a secondary task designed to increase working memory load, suggesting that when a task step plays a device-oriented role it is more weakly represented in memory. We conclude that device-oriented task steps are inherently problematic and should be avoided where possible in the design of task procedures.},

While the methodology includes a set of principles and themes, and provides significant leverage in the analysis of control room settings, the highly mobile nature of healthcare work throws up some unique challenges. We present an analysis of patient process management within a hospital using DiCoT. While the information flow and artefact analysis themes of the methodology were found to be useful in the analysis, the mobile nature of the work meant that the principles outlined for the physical theme only partially cover the issues of interest.},

abstract = {We distinguish diagrammatic from sentential paper-and-pencil representations of information by developing alternative models of information-processing systems that are informationally equivalent and that can be characterized as sentential or diagrammatic. Sentential representations are sequential, like the propositions in a text. Diagrammatic representations are indexed by location in a plane. Diagrammatic representations also typically display information that is only implicit in sentential representations and that therefore has to be computed, sometimes at great cost, to make it explicit for use. We then contrast the computational efficiency of these representations for solving several illustrative problems in mathematics and physics. When two representations are informationally equivalent, their computational efficiency depends on the information-processing operators that act on them. Two sets of operators may differ in their capabilities for recognizing patterns, in the inferences they can carry out directly, and in their control strategies (in particular, the control of search). Diagrammatic and sentential representations support operators that differ in all of these respects. Operators working on one representation may recognize features readily or make inferences directly that are difficult to realize in the other representation. Most important, however, are differences in the efficiency of search for information and in the explicitness of information. In the representations we call diagrammatic. information is organized by location, and often much of the information needed to make on inference is present and explicit at a single location. In addition. cues to the next logical step in the problem may be present at on adjacent location. Therefore problem solving can proceed through a smooth traversal of the diagram, and may require very little search or computation of elements that had been implicit.},

abstract = {The interruptions people experience may be initiated from digital devices but also from oneself, an action which is termed " self-interruption. " Prior work mostly focused on understanding work-related self-interruptions and designing tools for mitigating them in work contexts. However, self-interruption to off-tasks (e.g., viewing social networking sites, and playing mobile games) has received little attention in the HCI community thus far. We conducted a formative study about self-interruptions to off-tasks and coping strategies in multi-device working environments. Off-task usage was considered a serious roadblock to productivity, and yet, the habitual usage and negative triggers made it challenging to manage off-task usage. To mitigate these concerns, we developed " PomodoLock, " a self-interruption management tool that allows users voluntarily to set a timer for a fixed period, during which it selectively blocks interruption sources across multiple devices. To understand the effect of restricting access to self-interruptive sources such as applications and websites, we conducted a three-week field trial (n=40) where participants were asked to identify disrupting apps and sites to be blocked, but the multi-device blocking feature was only provided to the experimental group. Our study results showed the perceived coercion and the stress of the experimental group were lower despite its behavioral restriction with multi-device blocking. Qualitative study results from interviews and surveys confirm that multi-device blocking significantly reduced participants' mental effort for managing self-interruptions, thereby leading to a reduction in the overall stress level. The findings suggest that when the coerciveness of behavioral restriction is appropriately controlled, coercive design can positively assist users in achieving their goals.},

Further, we directly measured stress using wearable heart rate monitors and found that stress, as measured by heart rate variability, was lower without email.

abstract = {Information behavior (IB) research involves examining how people look for and use information, often with the sole purpose of gaining insights into the behavior displayed. However, It is also possible to examine IB with the purpose of using the insights gained to design new tools or improve the design of existing tools to support information seeking and use. This approach is advocated by David Ellis who, over two decades ago, presented a model of information seeking behaviors and made suggestions for how electronic tools might be designed to support these behaviors. Ellis also recognized that IBs might be used as the basis for evaluating as well as designing electronic resources. In this article, we present the IB evaluation methods. These two novel methods, based on an extension of Ellis's model, use the empirically observed IBs of lawyers as a framework for structuring user-centered evaluations of the functionality and usability of electronic resources. In this article, we present the IB methods and illustrate their use through the discussion of two examples. We also discuss benefits and limitations, grounded in specific features of the methods. {\textcopyright} 2008 ASIS{\&}T. Published online 7 August 2008 in Wiley InterScience.},

Results
- interrupted themselves 3 times per hour on average
7 categories of switching

1. Adjustment: improve work environment
2. Break: perform more desirable task
3. Inquiry: users sought out additional information to aid them in primary task
4. Recollection: users remembered they needed to perform different task
5. Routine: user interrupted themselves out of habit
6. Trigger: user initiated new task that was cued by stimulus in primary task
7. Wait: when user had to wait in order to continue primary task

routine most frequently observed type
triggers occurred least often but had longest duration

Motivation
breaks, recollections, routines: inititated by internal processes

Here we show that the most common digits being used when programming infusion pumps to administer drugs to patients are 0, 1, 2 and 5. The digit 9 is also frequently used to set an infusion to run at the maximum rate possible. With this information, we evaluate three current forms of infusion pump input with regards to the digits that are actually being programmed into the machines.

A preliminary user study was carried out to provide some initial evidence about the benefits of large versus small display surfaces for complex, multi-application office work. Significant benefits were observed in the use of a prototype, larger display, in addition to significant positive user preference and satisfaction with its use over a small display. In addition, design guidelines for enhancing user interaction across large display surfaces were identified.

In this paper, we report an experiment that demonstrates how these performance characteristics impact whether people will elect to use an audio interface in a multitasking situation. While steering a simulated vehicle, participants had to locate a source of information in a short passage of text. The text was presented either on a visual interface, or using a text-to-speech audio interface. The relative importance of each task was varied. A no-choice/choice paradigm was used in which participants first gained experience with each of the two interfaces, before being given a choice on which interface to use on later trials. The characteristics of the interaction with the interfaces, as measured in the no-choice phase, and the relative importance of each task, had an impact on which output modality was chosen in the choice phase. Participants that prioritized the secondary task tended to select the (faster yet more distracting) visual interface over the audio interface, and as a result had poorer lane keeping performance. This work demonstrates how a user's task objective will influence modality choices with multimodal devices in multitask environments.},

abstract = {Background: Medication safety is a pressing concern for residential aged care facilities (RACFs). Retrospective studies in RACF settings identify inadequate communication between RACFs, doctors, hospitals and community pharmacies as the major cause of medication errors. Existing literature offers limited insight about the gaps in the existing information exchange process that may lead to medication errors. The aim of this research was to explicate the cognitive distribution that underlies RACF medication ordering and delivery to identify gaps in medication-related information exchange which lead to medication errors in RACFs. Methods: The study was undertaken in three RACFs in Sydney, Australia. Data were generated through ethnographic field work over a period of five months (May-September 2011). Triangulated analysis of data primarily focused on examining the transformation and exchange of information between different media across the process. Results: The findings of this study highlight the extensive scope and intense nature of information exchange in RACF medication ordering and delivery. Rather than attributing error to individual care providers, the explication of distributed cognition processes enabled the identification of gaps in three information exchange dimensions which potentially contribute to the occurrence of medication errors namely: (1) design of medication charts which complicates order processing and record keeping (2) lack of coordination mechanisms between participants which results in misalignment of local practices (3) reliance on restricted communication bandwidth channels mainly telephone and fax which complicates the information processing requirements. The study demonstrates how the identification of these gaps enhances understanding of medication errors in RACFs. Conclusions: Application of the theoretical lens of distributed cognition can assist in enhancing our understanding of medication errors in RACFs through identification of gaps in information exchange. Understanding the dynamics of the cognitive process can inform the design of interventions to manage errors and improve residents' safety. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

annote = {- problem: visual checking not sufficient; usually blamed on limit on human attention
- this paper: reformation of checking procedures to improve reliability
employs deterministic method to evaluate techniques for human error detection

human error occurs, so we should focus on method of checking instead of improving human ability

Problems with checking
1) omission: people often overlook necessity to check
2) subjective judgment: we don't think logically, and can still read incorrect sentences

human behavior can be categorized into skill, rule, knowledge (SRK model)
={\textgreater} probability that people detect their own errors depends on SRK level of activity

DDE:
+ universality, convenience, no need to know correct answer
- 10-15{\%} errors in typed data still occur 
- requires double cost and labor

Additional info:
- humans not suitable to verify numerical check-digits
- meaning behind data will support error detection [e.g. 10]

Prediction human reliability
- hard to predict quantitatively, so uses deterministic risk estimation (spectrum between tasks almost everyone succeeds at and tasks almost everyone fails at)

Improvement of checking process against ommission
- make processes static; allows standstills and during these intermissions we can carry out checks
- check on checks and by others
={\textgreater} have 'checkpoints' where people switch work and check each other's work

Example food industry
- many checks a day required
- few tools to remind workers of necessary checks
={\textgreater} check gate: now checks started on the hour, time-driven reminder

Final check gate
- majority of errors happen at the end of job; people relax attention if nearing end of job

staticization method: increases accuracy checking
time-driven method: prevents omission of checking

Improvement of objectivity
- avoid yes/no questions (because of yes bias); don't ask is light on but how much lux does it emit?; requires more time and cognitive effort to answer 
- double checking improves reliability, but repeating same checking twice does not increase trustworthiness; need to assign different roles
={\textgreater} checker/observer
- more checkers does not guarantee reliability

1) staticization of workflow
2) independency triggering checks 
3) objective questioning},

abstract = {With the ever increasing amount of digital information, users desire more screen real estate to process daily desktop computing work, and might well benefit from using a large high-resolution display for information management. Unfortunately, we know very little about users' behaviors when using such a display for daily computing, and current user interfaces are mainly designed for normal-sized desktop monitors, which might not well suit a large display. In this article, we first present a longitudinal study that investigates how users manage overflowing digital information on a wall-sized display in a personal desktop computing context by comparing it with single and dual desktop monitors. Results showed users' unanimous preferences of working on a large display and revealed large-display users' unique activity patterns of managing windows. Guided by the study results, we designed a set of interaction techniques that provide greater flexibility in managing multiple windows. They include facile methods for selecting, moving, and resizing multiple windows using an active window boundary called Fringe, rearranging selected windows using multi- and single-window marking menus, packing/unpacking the selected windows using easily activated icons, and freely adjusting the order of overlapping windows with a Jab-to-Lift operation. We coherently integrated these techniques with traditional operations in a large-display window management prototype called WallTop. Two rounds of usability testing showed that users can quickly and easily learn the new interaction techniques and apply them to realistic window management tasks on a large display with increased efficiency. {\textcopyright} 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

Since people generally make this decision about which message to read before opening the email, the question largely unanswered in the email literature is: what surface features of an email draw attention to it? In this research, we examined how top-level cues about an email's content influence attention to email. We describe results from a think-aloud study examining people's stated rationale for prioritizing certain emails over others. Based on these results and theory on curiosity, we conducted an experiment examining how message importance, subject line specificity, workload and personal utility influence attention to email. Results suggest that uncertainty about message content at the inbox level increases the likelihood of attention to a message. The influence of uncertainty diminishes, however, in the face of enhanced task and personal utility cues and increased demand, suggesting that curiosity operates in an intrinsic way in the email context. Our results have implications for intelligent email system design, email client interfaces, and reducing email strain.},

1. pre-task: designing tasks so that they are resistant to poor responses
2. post-hoc: controlling/correcting for workers' outputs


Advantages current approach
+ model can generalize across tasks
+ potential to improve predictions beyond theoretical limits of just using worker's identity and end product
+ doesn't require knowledge of 'correct' answers
+ can scale down to small worker pool, making judgments about individual workers

information about the delays collected:
- how long user spent 'off focus' from page
- cumulative time they spent before they started typing in a field
- cumulative time they spent between keystrokes in a form field

- poor cross-browser compatibility
- privacy issues

abstract = {UNLABELLED: Touch screens are popular nowadays as seen on public kiosks, industrial control panels and personal mobile devices. Numerical typing is one frequent task performed on touch screens, but this task on touch screen is subject to human errors and slow responses. This study aims to find innate differences of touch screens from standard physical keypads in the context of numerical typing by eliminating confounding issues. Effects of precise visual feedback and urgency of numerical typing were also investigated. The results showed that touch screens were as accurate as physical keyboards, but reactions were indeed executed slowly on touch screens as signified by both pre-motor reaction time and reaction time. Provision of precise visual feedback caused more errors, and the interaction between devices and urgency was not found on reaction time. To improve usability of touch screens, designers should focus more on reducing response complexity and be cautious about the use of visual feedback. PRACTITIONER SUMMARY: The study revealed that slower responses on touch screens involved more complex human cognition to formulate motor responses. Attention should be given to designing precise visual feedback appropriately so that distractions or visual resource competitions can be avoided to improve human performance on touch screens.},
annote = {RQ1: do users perform differently on touch screens and physical keyboards in the context of numerical typing?

RQ2: does the use of touch screen cause higher response complexity in terms of motor programming and imply innate difficulty of use?

RQ3: is urgency level an influential factor to consider when it comes to choosing touch screens or physical keyboards?

RQ4: is the provision of precise positional information through visual feedback helpful, regardless of urgency level, or not?

- Arndt et al. 1994; O'Hara, Higgins, and Brown 2008; Thimbleby and Cairns 2010
- number pads police forces (Thomas and MccIelland 1996)

Experiment
IV: type of keyboard, urgency
urgency: bonus if correct responses made within 600 ms, or just fixed rate per hour independent of performance
- computer read out 30 numbers of 9 digits at rate of 1 digit per second; 2.5 second pause between numbers, small pause in between every three digits
={\textgreater} participants told to type out numbers digit-by-digit
={\textgreater} clearly instructed to not remember entire number; this would degrade reaction time
urgent trial: part. told that performance-based reward would apply
non-urgent trial: part. told to maintain accuracy, but quick responses not necessary

Results
- reaction time on physical keyboard faster
- when not urgent, no difference in accuracy
- urgency reduced reaction time but increased errors (in all keyboard types)
- urgency had effects on workload
- physical keyboard lower temporal workload

Limitation: all participants young, healthy adults and skilled typers

Conclusion: touch screens require longer reaction time for numerical typing, due to not only slower response but also higher response complexity that may involve cognitive factors

Future work:
- difference between typing (and keyboard types) if people are standing or sitting?},

In particular, we wondered whether long-lasting, time-sensitive tasks that require continuous concentration could work successfully online, given the confounding effects that might accompany the online deployment of such a task. We ran an archetypal interruption experiment both online and in the lab to investigate whether studies demonstrating such characteristics might be more vulnerable to a loss of control than the short, time-insensitive studies that are representative of the majority of previous online studies. Statistical comparisons showed no significant differences in performance on a number of dimensions. However, there were issues with data quality that stemmed from participants misunderstanding the task. Our findings suggest that long-lasting experiments using time-sensitive performance measures can be run online but that care must be taken when introducing participants to experimental procedures.},

We describe the methodology of conducting a CASSM analysis and illustrate the approach with three contrasting worked examples (a robotic arm, a digital library system and a drawing tool) that demonstrate different depths of analysis. We show how CASSM can help identify re-design possibilities to improve system utility. CASSM complements established evaluation methods by focusing on conceptual structures rather than procedures. Prototype tool support for completing a CASSM analysis is provided by Cassata, an open source development. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {When an automating application needs a user's input or has feedback or other information for that user, it typically engages the user immediately, interrupting the user's current task. To empirically validate why unnecessarily interrupting a user's task should be avoided, we designed an experiment measuring the effects of an interruption on a user's task performance, annoyance, and anxiety. Fifty subjects participated in the experiment. The results demonstrate that an interruption has a disruptive effect on both a user's task performance and emotional state, and that the degree of disruption depends on the user's mental load at the point of interruption. We discuss the implications of these results in terms of building a system to better coordinate interactions between the user and applications competing for that user's attention.},

abstract = {A significant amount of interaction involves number entry. The purpose of any number entry interface is to accurately select or set a numeric value. There are two main styles of number entry interfaces found on medical devices: serial interfaces like the ubiquitous 12-key numeric keypad, and incremental interfaces that use a knob or a pair of keys to increase or decrease numbers. We report an experiment that investigates the effect of interface design on error detection in number entry. The initial findings show that the incremental interface produces more accurate inputs than the serial interface, and the magnitude of errors suggests that the incremental interface could reduce the death rate relative to the numeric keypad.},
annote = {- interaction was with a mouse, which was used to click on keys on screen
- Interface 1: based on Graseby 500, serial interface
- Interace 2: based on Alaris, incremental interface
- key bounce triggered for 4 entries to see if users would detect and correct errors
- within-subject repeated measures design
IV: interface style (serial/incremental)
DV: number of undetected errors, number of corrected errors, total eye fixation time on input and display, task completion time
two parts of experiment: interface 1 and 2. before each part, training session where they could enter 10 numbers to get familiar with interface
- instructed to enter numbers as accurately and as fast as possible
- showed one number at a time, had to click 'next' to confirm entry and go to next number
- participants had to enter 100 numbers for each interface




- incremental interface produces more accurate inputs than serial interface- serial entry is quickest method for arbitrary number entry, and coincides with how numbers are spoken in many Western languages
- incremental entry: entry is about changes to a current number
- when people interact with incremental interface, 'requires users to monitor how the value on the display changes' ={\textgreater} hypothesis that users will more likely detect and correct errors
- H2: will pay more visual attention to display than input in incremental, and more attention to input in serial interface
Results:
- no learning effect (no faster execution time further in experiment)
- all but 2 participants made at least one undetected error
- mean undetected errors for incremental interface was significantly lower than for serial interface
- total undetected forced errors per participant significantly lower for incremental interface
- number of corrected errors per participant greater in incremental interface
- visual fixation on input greater than display in serial
- visual fixation on input lower than display in incremental
- speed of entry per trial significantly slower for incremental
- missing decimal more in serial interface (not in incremental)
- transposition (swapping digits) more in incremental, mostly after decimal point
={\textgreater} could be due to trailing zero, i.e. 7.40 instead of 7.4, easily mistaken for 7.04
- wrong digit more frequent on incremental, more serious on serial
- missing digit more in serial (not in incremental)
- incremental: less errors, longer execution time
explanations for less errors: 1) took a longer time, 2) more attention on display, 3) participants expect to make errors in this interface (more corrected errors)
serial interface prone to syntax errors but impossible on incremental interface
- in serial, numbers can be perceived as string of characters whereas incremental forces uers to be aware of numeric values and order},

Interruption length affected errors involving loss of place in the procedure (sequence errors) but not errors involving incorrect execution of a correct step (nonsequence errors), implicating memory for past performance, rather than generalized attentional resources, as the disrupted cognitive process. Within the category of sequence errors, interruption length produced a complex pattern of effects, with repetitions of the preinterruption step showing different effects than errors at other offsets from the correct step. A cognitive model we developed previously accounts for the results in terms of decay and rehearsal of memory for past performance and activation spreading through a procedural representation of task knowledge. The model links different types of errors to different cognitive processes, informs potential interventions, and predicts interruption effects for sequential tasks like problem solving and counting.},

Furthermore, the information behaviour of local government policy workers has not been widely studied. We conducted semi-structured interviews with local government policy workers from UK local authorities and local government organisations. This was with the aim of examining how these policy workers use information to prepare documents. During the interviews, we asked the policy workers to demonstrate how they extracted information from source documents and how they made use of it. We found that the document preparation process involved three key phases: (1) information management (storing and recording information retrieved online for later use), (2) writing and editing (extracting information from source material and using it to support the writing process), and (3) review and sign-off (managing an iterative process of obtaining feedback from multiple stakeholders and making amendments). We discuss key challenges the interviewees faced during each of these phases and make recommendations for the design of future digital information environments aimed at providing holistic support for local government policy workers' information use behaviour.},

A study was conducted in which participants drove a simulated vehicle and occasionally dialed a telephone number on a mobile phone. Experimental instructions and feedback encouraged participants to focus on either driving or dialing. Results show that participants adapted their task interleaving strategies to meet the required task objective, but in a manner that was nonetheless intricately shaped by internal psychological constraints. In particular, participants tended to steer in between dialing chunks of digits even when extreme vehicle drift implied that more reactive strategies would have generated better lane keeping. To better understand why drivers interleaved tasks at chunk boundaries, a modeling analysis was conducted to derive performance predictions for a range of dialing strategies. The analysis supported the idea that interleaving at chunk boundaries efficiently traded the time given up to dialing with the maintenance of a central lane position. We discuss the implications of this work in terms of contributions to understanding how cognitive constraints shape strategy adaptations in dynamic multitask environments.},

It is however difficult for spreadsheet users to correctly assess the quality of spreadsheets, especially with respect to their understandability. Understandability of spreadsheets is important, since spreadsheets often have a long lifespan, during which they are used by several users. In this paper, we establish a set of spreadsheet understandability metrics. We start by studying related work and interviewing 40 spreadsheet professionals to obtain a set of characteristics that might contribute to understandability problems in spreadsheets. Based on those characteristics we subsequently determine a number of understandability metrics. To evaluate the usefulness of our metrics, we conducted a series of experiments in which professional spreadsheet users performed a number of small maintenance tasks on a set of spreadsheets from the EUSES spreadsheet corpus. We subsequently calculate the correlation between the metrics and the performance of subjects on these tasks. The results clearly indicate that the number of ranges, the nesting depth and the presence of conditional operations in formulas significantly increase the difficulty of understanding a spreadsheet.},

abstract = {It is commonly hypothesized that external representations serve as memory aids and improve task performance by means of expanding the limited capacity of working memory. However, very few studies have directly examined this memory aid hypothesis. By systematically manipulating how information is available externally versus internally in a sequential number comparison task, three experiments were designed to investigate the relation between external representations and working memory. The experimental results show that when the task requires information from both external representations and working memory, it is the interaction of information from the two sources that determines task performance. In particular, when information from the two sources does not match well, external representations hinder instead of enhance task performance. The study highlights the important role the coordination among different representations plays in distributed cognition. The general relations between external representations and working memory are discussed.},

1. to explore whether a task always becomes easier when more information is in external representations and less information is in internal representations
2. to explore how different representations are coordinated and how digits in different representations are matched and compared

Those mechanisms are usually judged on speed, security, and memorability in comparison with traditional PIN entry systems. It remains unclear, however, what appropriate values for PIN-based ATM authentication actually are. We conducted a field study and two smaller follow-up studies on real-world ATM use, in order to provide both a better understanding of PIN-based ATM authentication, and on how alternative authentication methods can be compared and evaluated. Our results show that there is a big influence of contextual factors on security and performance in PIN-based ATM use. Such factors include distractions, physical hindrance, trust relationships, and memorability. From these findings, we draw several implications for the design of alternative ATM authentication systems, such as resilience to distraction and social compatibility.},

abstract = {This purpose of the present study was to compare the effects of three types of graphic feedback on worker performance and satisfaction. The first type displayed individual performance (IF), the second displayed individual performance and average group performance (SCF-GA), and the third displayed individual performance for each individual in the group (SCF-IP). Participants were 54 undergraduate students who were randomly assigned to one of the three groups. They performed a computerized data entry task that simulated the job of a medical data entry clerk. The primary dependent variable was the number of correctly completed patient records. Secondary dependent variables included: (1) time on-task, (2) accuracy, and (3) data entry rate. The first session was used as a covariate to control for keyboard skills and a monotone ANCOVA was used to determine whether performance differed among the groups. A post-study questionnaire was used to assess performer satisfaction, and ANOVAs were conducted to determine whether satisfaction differed. There was a statistically significant difference in the performances of each group, in ranked order: IF {\textless} SCF-GA {\textless} SCF-IP. There were no statistically significant differences found for any of the satisfaction questions. Collectively, these results imply that organizations would gain maximum performance increases by providing graphic feedback that displays the individual performances of each individual. Results also showed that under these particular experimental conditions, participants did not find the SCF-IP any more aversive than IF or SCF-GA. Participant performance, participant satisfaction, and suggestions for future research are discussed in detail.},

abstract = {Soft constraints hypothesis (SCH) is a rational analysis approach that holds that the mixture of perceptual-motor and cognitive resources allocated for interactive behavior is adjusted based on temporal cost-benefit tradeoffs. Alternative approaches maintain that cognitive resources are in some sense protected or conserved in that greater amounts of perceptual-motor effort will be expended to conserve lesser amounts of cognitive effort. One alternative, the minimum memory hypothesis (MMH), holds that people favor strategies that minimize the use of memory. SCH is compared with MMH across 3 experiments and with predictions of an Ideal Performer Model that uses ACT-R's memory system in a reinforcement learning approach that maximizes expected utility by minimizing time. Model and data support the SCH view of resource allocation; at the under 1000-ms level of analysis, mixtures of cognitive and perceptual-motor resources are adjusted based on their cost-benefit tradeoffs for interactive behavior.},

A user study showed that Feldspar is easy to use, and suggested that it might be faster than conventional browsing and searching for these kinds of retrieval tasks. Feldspar could be an important addition to search and browsing tools.},

abstract = {Two experiments were conducted to examine whether checking one's own work can be motivated by monetary reward and punishment. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: a flat-rate payment for completing the task (Control); payment increased for error-free performance (Reward); payment decreased for error performance (Punishment). Experiment 1 (N = 90) was conducted with liberal arts students, using a general data-entry task. Experiment 2 (N = 90) replicated Experiment 1 with clinical students and a safety-critical ‘cover story' for the task. In both studies, Reward and Punishment resulted in significantly fewer errors, more frequent and longer checking, than Control. No such differences were obtained between the Reward and Punishment conditions. It is concluded that error consequences in terms of monetary reward and punishment can result in more accurate task performance and more rigorous checking behaviour than errors without consequences. However, whether punishment is more effective than reward, or vice versa, remains inconclusive.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a computational cognitive model of task interruption and resumption, focusing on the effects of the problem state bottleneck. Previous studies have shown that the disruptiveness of interruptions is for an important part determined by three factors: interruption duration, interrupting-task complexity, and moment of interruption. However, an integrated theory of these effects is still missing. Based on previous research into multitasking, we propose a first step towards such a theory in the form of a process model that attributes these effects to problem state requirements of both the interrupted and the interrupting task. Subsequently, we tested two predictions of this model in two experiments. The experiments confirmed that problem state requirements are an important predictor for the disruptiveness of interruptions. This suggests that interfaces should be designed to a) interrupt users at low-problem state moments and b) maintain the problem state for the user when interrupted.},

We present a week-long study that investigates large display use in a personal desktop computing context by comparing it with single and dual desktop monitor use. Results show users' unanimous preference for using a large display: it facilitates multi-window and rich information tasks, enhances users' awareness of peripheral applications, and offers a more “immersive” experience. Further, the data reveals distinct usage patterns in partitioning screen real estate and managing windows on a large display. Detailed analysis of these results provides insights into designing interaction techniques and window management systems more suited to a large display.},

annote = {- compared wall-size display with single and dual desktop monitor use
Main findings
- people prefer large display: facilitates multi-window and rich information tasks, enhances awareness peripheral applications, offers more immersive experience
[8, 9]: benefits of using larger displays for personal desktop work
[10]: users rely on multiple monitors
[1, 9]: large display improves task switching
[10]: a second monitor can improve work efficiency
similarities and differences of using multiple monitors versus a single large display:
- bezels of multiple montiors introduce seam into overall screen and viewing experience (one display is seamless)
- physical sizes can be quite different, even if number of pixels are similar
={\textgreater} prior research on multiple monitors does not necessarily translate to single display

Method
recruited 8 participants: 4 who used single-monitor, 4 who used dual-monitor; wanted to see how their interaction and visualisation strategies might change when moving to a single large display; five days, 5 hours a day; asked to perform their daily work (and still able to use their normal working environment outside these hours)
- each participant maintained diary; wrote down activities every half an hour, listing advantages/disadvantages of doing it on a large display
- follow-up interview at end of each day
- VibeLog to record every window event

Results
- participants preferred large display: 90{\%} was better/equal, and over 50{\%} was better
={\textgreater} could choose optimal amount of screen space according to task at hand
- single-monitor users had stronger preference for using large display than dual-monitor users
- spreadsheet work: 3 participants, all preferred large display because huge number of spreadsheet cells that could be kept visible simultaneously
- programming tasks: able to have search/help documents open next to coding window; otherwise having to interleave between them
- all dual-monitor participants partitioned screens into focal and peripheral regions:
={\textgreater} focal region used for primary tasks
={\textgreater} peripheral region used for applications that are secondary, e.g. e-mail, IM, to-do lists
- single-monitor did not do this, but did do it on larger display
- dual monitors: one monitor had 71{\%} of mouse events
={\textgreater} dual monitors suffers from visual discontinuities, so primary tasks kept to one screen
={\textgreater} on large display, 81{\%} of mouse events in center of screen
- difference of arrangement application windows
={\textgreater} in dual, did not bother to arrange application windows: throw all non-primary applications on second screen and interact with it when they need it
={\textgreater} on large display, spend more effort to optimise layout of windows
two common strategies for arranging windows:
1. applications requiring interaction, such as word and IM, close to center of screen, and passive information showing applications, such as weather or calendar, to corner
2. arrange windows according to relevance to primary task; the more relevant, the closer to primary window
Difference in interacting with applications peripheral region
1. on dual monitors: users turned head and bodies to work on applications secondary monitor, only dragged them to other screen if working on it for extended period of time; monitors close to each other so only required slight head or body movement
2. on large display: often dragged peripheral applications from peripheral into focal region, did not move head or bodies (even though more time consuming, more comfortable than rotating head or body)
much more moving and resizing windows on large display; almost no maximising of windows; usually resizing window to 60-70{\%} of screen sufficient ={\textgreater} suggests there is an upper bound of window size that users are comfortable with
- minimising done on single and dual to save screen space, but rarely done on large display

Benefits large display
1. multi-window tasks: interleaving between windows can be reduced
2. rich information tasks: does not have to scroll left/right and up/down in spreadsheet, reduces navigation overhead
3. awareness of peripheral applications: can improve work productivity, able to see to-do lists, email, etc. whereas in smaller screen only primary application window fully visible
4. immersive experience: engaged people more in daily work; felt ‘surrounded' by task

Design recommendations
- legibility (peripheral further from focal attention so increase font size)
- quick switching and moving
- simplified layout
- additional window operations: more likely to move and resize windows on large display; less likely to minimise and maximise},

abstract = {Examined immediate memory performance for multiple digit numbers in a practical read-and-key or listen-and-key task, and to evaluate the most effective ways of presenting multiple digit numbers. Variables measured were list length (4-10 digits), presentation mode (visual simultaneously, auditory), grouping format (1+1, 2+2, 3+3) and presentation time (0.5 sec/digit, 1.0 sec/digit). 144 subjects (aged 18-37 yrs) participated. Not surprisingly, list length is a vital factor in recall. A longer presentation time was advantageous for both modes, while an effect of mode was observed only for the ungrouped numbers, where the auditory condition was inferior. The serial position curves showed primacy and recency with auditory presentation, and primacy and a superior performance on the middle part of the list using visual presentation. Local serial position effects revealed that ungrouped numbers presented visually are subjectively grouped in twos. The results have broad implications in the human factors area.

Two studies explore the extent to which this deeper processing engendered by disfluency interventions can lead to improved memory performance. Study 1 found that information in hard-to-read fonts was better remembered than easier to read information in a controlled laboratory setting. Study 2 extended this finding to high school classrooms. The results suggest that superficial changes to learning materials could yield significant improvements in educational outcomes.},

evidence that disfluency typically leads to reduced liking (Reber, Winkielman {\&} Schwarz, 1998)
Rhodes and Castel (2008) experimented with font size and did not find an effect: but small font was still 18 pt so not disfluent enough to bring about deeper processing

Study 1
- 28 participants, 18-40
- asked to learn about 3 species, each of which had 7 features
- between-subjects
- disfluent condition: 12-point Comic Sans 60{\%} grayscale font, or 12-point Bodoni 60{\%} grayscale
- fluent condition: 16-point Arial pure black font
- given 90s to memorise information
- distraction tasks for 15 min
- then memory test
- disfluent (86.5{\%}) more questions right than fluent (72.8{\%})
- no diff. between 2 disfluent fonts

problems with generalization first study:
- time between learning and testing normally much longer in real world school setting ({\textgreater}15 min)
- diff between lab and classroom: learning strategies, learning material, distractions environment
- because more difficult, less motivated students might become frustrated

Study 2
- 222 high-school students, 15-18
- worksheets and Powerpoint slides manipulated
- disfluent: one of 3 fonts or moving paper up and down during copying
- control: material unedited
- teachers blind to hypothesis
- 4-question survey after exam to test motivation
- disfluent scored higher (M=.164) than control (M=-.295)
- no diff. between disfluent fonts
- no diff. in motivation based on fluency

- could be that effects were driven by fact that hard-to-read fonts were more distinctive

It is a practice that has become increasingly common with the advent of ``at your fingertips'' information resources, To explore the characteristics of information triage and its interaction with spatial hypertext, a medium we claim supports the process, we have studied subjects engaged in a time-constrained decision-making task using a large set of relevant documents. We use the study task to investigate information triage under three different conditions: one in which the participants used paper documents, and two others in which the participants used variants of VIKI, a spatial hypertext system. Our findings suggest that during information triage attentional resources are devoted to evaluating materials and organizing them, so they can be read and reread as they return to mind. Accordingly, hypertext tools to support the practice should facilitate the rapid assimilation and assessment of new material, aid in the creation and management of a fluid category structure, allow readers to track their own progress through the information, and use minimum-effort methods to promote the intelligibility of results.},

Effects of speech rates (500-ms vs. 1000-ms interval), urgency (urgent condition: performance-based monetary incentive plus time limit vs. non-urgent condition: flat-rate compensation) and finger strategies (single vs. multi-finger typing) on typing speed and accuracy were investigated. Fast speech rate and multi-finger typing produced more errors and slower typing speed. Urgency improved typing speed but decreased accuracy. Errors were almost doubled under urgent condition, while urgency effect on speed was similar to that of speech rate. Examination of error patterns did not fully support Salthouse's (1986) speculations about error-making mechanisms. The results implied that urgency could play a more important role in error-making than task demands. Numerical keyboard design and error detection could benefit from spatial incidence of errors found in this study. STATEMENT OF RELEVANCE: This study revealed that classic speculations about error-making mechanisms in alphabetical typing do not necessarily translate to numerical typing. Factors other than external task demands such as urgency can affect typing performance to a similar or greater extent. Investigations of intrinsic error-making factors in non-traditional typing tasks are encouraged.},

In the process, a myriad of analytical and visualisation techniques are employed to generate a visual representation of the data. These often introduce their own uncertainties, in addition to the ones inherent in the data, and these propagated and compounded uncertainties can result in impaired decision making. The user's confidence or trust in the results depends on the extent of user's awareness of the underlying uncertainties generated on the system side. This paper unpacks the uncertainties that propagate through visual analytics systems, illustrates how human's perceptual and cognitive biases influence the user's awareness of such uncertainties, and how this affects the user's trust building. The knowledge generation model for visual analytics is used to provide a terminology and framework to discuss the consequences of these aspects in knowledge construction and though examples, machine uncertainty is compared to human trust measures with provenance.

In this article, we therefore contrast external interruptions with self-interruptions. Three multitasking experiments were conducted, in which we examined changes in pupil size when participants switched from a primary to a secondary task. Results showed an increase in pupil dilation several seconds before a self-interruption, which we could attribute to the decision to switch. This indicates that the decision takes a relatively large amount of time. This was supported by the fact that in Experiment 2, participants were significantly slower on the self-interruption blocks than on the external interruption blocks. These findings suggest that the decision to switch is costly, but may also be open for modification through appropriate training. In addition, we propose that if one must switch tasks, it can be more efficient to implement a forced switch after the completion of a subtask instead of leaving the decision to the user.},

abstract = {This paper brings the intellectual tools of cognitive science to bear on resolving the "paradox of the active user" [Interfacing Thought: Cognitive Aspects of Human-Computer Interaction, Cambridge, MIT Press, MA, USA]-the persistent use of inefficient procedures in interactive tasks by experienced or even expert users when demonstrably more efficient procedures exist. The goal of this paper is to understand the roots of this paradox by finding regularities in these inefficient procedures. We examine three very different data sets. For each data set, we first satisfy ourselves that the preferred procedures used by some subjects are indeed less efficient than the recommended procedures. We then amass evidence, for each set, and conclude that when a preferred procedure is used instead of a more efficient, recommended procedure, the preferred procedure tends to have two major characteristics: (1) the preferred procedure is a well-practiced, generic procedure that is applicable either within the same task environment in different contexts or across different task environments, and (2) the preferred procedure is composed of interactive components that bring fast, incremental feedback on the external problem states. The support amassed for these characteristics leads to a new understanding of the paradox. In interactive tasks, people are biased towards the use of general procedures that start with interactive actions. These actions require much less cognitive effort as each action results in an immediate change to the external display that, in turn, cues the next action. Unfortunately for the users, the bias to use interactive unit tasks leads to a path that requires more effort in the long run. Our data suggest that interactive behavior is composed of a series of distributed choices; that is, people seldom make a once-and-for-all decision on procedures. This series of biased selection of interactive unit tasks often leads to a stable suboptimal level of performance. ?? 2004 Cognitive Science Society, Inc. ?? 2004 Cognitive Science Society, Inc.

abstract = {It is well known that perceptual and conceptual fluency can influence episodic memory judgments. Here, the authors asked whether fluency arising from the motor system also impacts recognition memory. Past research has shown that the perception of letters automatically activates motor programs of typing actions in skilled typists. In this study, expert typists made more false recognition errors to letter dyads which would be easier or more fluent to type than nonfluent dyads, while no typing action was involved (Experiment 1). This effect was minimized with a secondary motor task that implicated the same fingers that would be used to type the presented dyads, but this effect remained with a noninterfering motor task (Experiment 2). Typing novices, as a comparison group, did not show fluency effects in recognition memory. These findings suggest that memory is influenced by covert simulation of actions associated with the items being judged-even when there is no intention to act-and highlight the intimate connections between higher level cognition and action.},

abstract = {Feedback is valuable for allowing us to improve on tasks.While retrospective feedback can help us improve for next time, feedback ‘in action' can allow us to improve the outcome of on-going tasks. In this article, we use data from functional Near InfraRed Spectroscopy to provide participants with feedback about their mental workload levels during high-workload tasks.We evaluate the impact of this feedback on task perfor- mance and perceived task performance, in comparison to industry standard mid-task self-assessments, and explore participants' perceptions of this feedback. In line with previouswork,we confirm that deploying self- reporting methods affect both perceived and actual performance. Conversely, we conclude that our objective concurrent feedback correlated more closely with task demand, supported reflection in action, and did not negatively affect performance. Future work, however, should focus on the design of this feedback and the potential behaviour changes that will result.},

abstract = {In a study of 10 information workers shadowed for 3 whole working days each, we utilize the construct of working sphere to model projects/tasks as a network of humans and artifacts. Employing a statistical technique called T-pattern analysis, we derive measures of routineness from these real-world data. In terms of routineness, we show that information workers experience archetypes of working spheres. The results indicate that T-patterns of interactions with information and computational media are important indicators of facets of routineness and that these measures are correlated with workers' affective states. Our results are some of the first to demonstrate how regular temporal patterns of media interaction in tasks are related to stress. These results suggest that designs of systems to facilitate so-called routine work should consider the degrees to which a person's working spheres fall along varying facets of routineness.},
annote = {Problem: most cognitive models that model routines see them as fixed patterns, while they are subject to variability. Often temporal aspect of routines is overlooked. 
What was done: 10 information workers were shadowed for 3 days. T-pattern analysis was used to derive measures of routineness from temporal viewpoint (e.g. time between media use, repetition of pattern). Regression analysis was done to study the relationship between routineness and mental state.  
What was found: Routineness and mental state are related, but depends on temporal aspects. 
Why does this matter: 
Knowledge: 
Allows a more accurate understanding of the costs of multitasking.  
demonstrates how regular temporal patterns of media interaction are related to stress. Useful to think of patterns of activity along spectrum of 'routineness' 
Design: 
can help develop systems that can gauge when procedures are too idiosyncratic to be automated versus routines that are worth calling 'routines' and have potential for technological facilitation 
recognition of routines can help in task recovery, semi-automation, representing the pattern of one's work day for reflection and future planning 
Method: 
T-pattern analysis provide means to parse out link between perceived stress and temporal structure of tasks},

From these interviews we distill four primary findings. First, associating a user's activities with a particular device is problematic for multiple device users because many activities span multiple devices. Second, device use varies by user and circumstance; users assign different roles to devices both by choice and by constraint. Third, users in industry want to separate work and personal activities across work and personal devices, but they have difficulty doing so in practice Finally, users employ a variety of techniques for accessing information across devices, but there is room for improvement: participants reported managing information across their devices as the most challenging aspect of using multiple devices. We suggest opportunities to improve the user experience by focusing on the user rather than the applications and devices; making devices aware of their roles; and providing lighter-weight methods for transferring information, including synchronization services that engender more trust from users.},

abstract = {Historically, usability evaluation methods (UEMs) have been evaluated on their capability for problem identification. However, the relevance of this approach has been questioned for applied usability work. To investigate alternative explanations of what is important for method use a grounded theory of usability practitioners was developed (9 interviews from the website domain and 13 in the safety-critical domain). The analysis proceeded in bottom-up and top-down stages. The bottom-up stages produced insight from the data in an exploratory and inductive manner. This highlighted the importance of contextual factors and the need for system descriptions: UEM adoption and adaptation cannot be fully understood devoid of context. The top-down stages used Distributed Cognition and Resilience Engineering conceptual frameworks as leverage for exploring the data in a deductive manner. These were chosen for their functional descriptions of systems. To illustrate the importance of context we describe three models: 1) where previous research has highlighted the downstream utility of UEMs we expand the metaphor to consider the landscape through which the stream flows, where the landscape represents the project's context; 2) where information propagation and transformation in a project is influenced by social, information flow, artefact, physical and evolutionary factors; and 3) where the functional couplings between parts of the system of usability practice can be monitored and managed to positively resonate with each other, thereby improving the performance of the system overall. The concept of ‘Positive Resonance' is introduced to describe how practitioners adapt to the context to maximise their impact under constrained resources. The functional couplings are described in a functional resonance model of HCI practice. This model is validated by interviewees and other practitioners outside of the study. This research shows that problem identification is limited for valuing UEMs. Instead, functional couplings of UEMs should be considered to improve system performance, which influence UEM adoption and adaptation in practice.},

VelociTap: sign. lower error rate than normal keyboard while retaining same entry rate
- sentence-based decoding
- 3 word-delimiter actions: space key, swiping, let decoder infer spaces
- 3 design aspects: 
1. intermediate feedback: does not affect entry or error rate
2. word-delimiter: space key provides best accuracy
3. keyboard size: 40 mm keyboard reaches 41 wpm with 3{\%} character error rate

novice errors can reach mean entry rate of 41 wpm on a 40mm wide keyboard (smartwatch-sized) with a 3{\%} error rate

new ways to redesign traditional QWERTY keyboard for mobile touch screen typing
- systems that adapt to user input
- gesture
automatic typing correction
- adapted to walking or standing, hand posture

sentence-based decoding: delay automatic typing correction until entire sentence has been typed

sentence-based entry: allows entry of words without spaces and performs separation/autocorrection when user hits space key
={\textgreater} design and performance not explored

Decoder
- search finds up to 50 best-sentence hypotheses; adds a probability to each hypothesis
- language models trained on blog, social media data

common touchscreen typing error is substituting one letter for another

Pilot 1
aim: explore performance potential of VelociTap and investigate if users could effectively tap out sentences without feedback from interface
- standard QWERTY keyboard in portrait
- stimuli sentences at top
- recorded touch events
- no audio, visual, tactile feedback
- displayed entry rate in wpm after completing sentence
- 45 participants, 18-57, 26{\%} female, 73{\%} 
students
- instructed to hold device in non-dominant hand and type with one finger of dominant hand
- 20 short sentences (3-8 words)
- short questionnaire afterwards

- entry rate: WPM with word being 5 characters incl. spaces
- timed entries: from sentence's first tap until moving to next sentence by tapping with two finger
- character error rate: nr of insertion/substitution/deletions required to turn recognized text into reference text, divided by nr of characters in reference text

Results pilot 1
- average entry rate: 46.8 wpm
- Character error rate: 4.7{\%}
- two-third of sentences no errors
- sentence-based: can search for best text given all data
={\textgreater} touch screen typically performs auto-correction only on previous word
- increasing freedom to change past characters improves accuracy, but small beyond window of 5 characters, so sentence-based similar to word-based, but added advantage that it avoids distracting users while entering text
- varying ow many previous characters decoder is allowed to change influence accuracy
={\textgreater} the bigger the window, the higher accuracy, but diminishes after window size of 5

Pilot 2
- investigate how practice and real-time feedback of results affects performance
- Google keyboard in portrait orientation
- taps had click sound and vibrated device
- entered 12 blocks of 20 sentences (2 hours, each sentence 5-10 words)
- 6 participants, 21-29, 1 female, 5 students
- feedback: after each block, average entry and error rate shown

Results pilot 2
- average entry rate: 50.5 wpm
- entry rate increased over time
- error rate: 4.5{\%}
- error rate did not increase

Experiment 1
- determine if lack of visual feedback contributes to fast entry rates
- within-subjects, IV type of feedback:
1. GoogleFeedback: vibrate, click sound, popups on each key press, auto-correction level 'very aggressive', hitting space to perform recognition, going to next sentence displayed entry/error rate for prev. sentence
2. VTFeedback: vibrate, click sound, key popup, swipe up to perform recognition, replaced nearest character text and displayed entry/error rate
3. VTNoFeedback: no visual feedback during entry, no key popups and no text until after recognition
- 24 participants, 18-32, 75{\%} male
- 60 sentences picked from 2nd pilot (20 in each condition)

Results exp 1
- entry rates similar: 43.4, 41.9, 43.5
- error rate higher in GoogleFeedback: 5.2{\%}, 1.8{\%}, 2.7{\%}
- GoogleFeedback: 10 times hit space key more than once, failed to perform decoding on 29 sentences
- no diff in backspace key use
- part. preferred VelociTap
- VelociTap uses more computational resources
- omitting intermediate visual feedback might have increased entry rate, also increased error rate

Experiment 2
- investigate impact of different actions users could take to delimit words
- within-subjects, IV type of delimiter action:
1. NoSpace
2. Space
3. Swipe
- intermediate feedback
- 24 participants, 18-46, 83{\%} male

Results Exp 2
- Swipe slowest
- NoSpace highest error rate
- NoSpace fewest backspaces
- participants preferred Space, then swipe, then NoSpace

Experiment 3
- investigate if setup can enable users to type on smaller keyboards
- within-subjects, 3 keyboard sizes (normal/small/tiny)
- 12 participants, 18-35, 67{\%} male
- 240 sentences

Results exp 3
- entry rate decreased as keyboard size decreased, but not sign.
- error rate increased as keyboard size decreased, Tiny sign. higher
- no diff. in use of swipe
- task load increased as keyboard size decreased, Tiny sign. higher
- space strategy most popular for all keyboard sizes

Conclusion
- VelociTap resulted in lower error rate than Google keyboard while retaining similar entry rate
- intermediate visual feedback does not sign. affect entry or error rates
- space key most reliable delimiter
- 40 mm keyboard smallest to remain acceptable performance

Future work
- user training to make no space delimiter more effective
- compare sentence-based with word-based, two-thumb typing
- test on actual smartwatch
- text entry instead of transcription},

annote = {problem: several alternatives for text entry on small devices, but unclear how each technique scales and which technique is appropriate for which device size
did user studies to evaluate 3 QWERTY-based soft keyboards for 3 different screen sizes

every text entry technique has to compete with qwerty; users only willing to switch if easy to use and learn

Zoomboard [29]: shows qwerty keyboard, taps to zoom in on specific region, additional tap to select character
- outperforms same-sized keyboard that provides no assistance
- use of multiple taps to enter single character makes it unlikely it would perform well on larger keyboards (and a number of commercial devices are larger)
- unclear for which size it would be good
- different types of assistance still largely unexplored


different screen sizes demand different keyboard techniques
three keyboards approach reasonable entry and error rate
users got quickly familiar

speech input: unsuitable for noisy environments or giving personal data
handwriting: difficult to see what is being written on very small screens
- prone to recognition errors

Himberg et al. [13]: adaptive numerical soft keyboard that observes where user is touching and adapts shape of virtual keys to reduce error rate

In summary, several studies have looked at number and text entry. While diverse alternatives have been proposed, 
Using adaptive interaction as theoretical framework, I assume that in number entry users will also be adaptive in choosing strategies.

ZoomBoard
Callout: call-outs showing character above the key aim to address occlusion (fat-finger) problem
+ one character per tap so may be more efficient than ZoomBoard
- once finger on touch screen, occludes most of the keyboard
ZShift
+ callout showing zoomed copy of occluded screen area

can enter space by space key or swiping to the right
swipe to the left to delete text
swipe up and down to load different keyboards (symbols and numbers, punctuation, etc.)
tap on upper part to submit

Evaluation
- controlled user study
- text-copy task
- repeated measures within-subjects design
- 9 conditions: keyboard typexsize
- DV: wpm, kspc (number of interactions to enter a character), cer (character error rate), cerr (corrected error rate), ceff (ease to correct errors), usability, workload
- phrases from MacKenzie and Soukoreff phrase set
- 5 phrases per condition (so 45 total)
- no punctuation or symbols, and lowercase
- phrase shown above each keyboard
- instructed to be as quickly and accurately as possible
- answered SUS and NASA-TLX afterwards

- Callout sign. lower wpm in small screen size
- Zoomboard sign. higher kspc for all screen sizes; ZShift best performer overall
- Callout worst CER in small screen size
- callout perceived worst, zoomboard perceived better in terms of SUS but not TLX
- TLX for medium: callout scored best

Type of errors:
- typos
- different word (although gramatically correct)
- fewer or more words than target phrase

- participants performed better in terms of wpm and kspc after time
- performance improved as screen size increased

Conclusion
users prefer ZoomBoard for small screen size
however, ZShift achieves similar performance
ZShift overall best performer for medium and large screen size},

abstract = {Forgetting what one was doing prior to interruption is an everyday problem. The recent soft constraints hypothesis (Gray, Sims, Fu, {\&} Schoelles, 2006) emphasizes the strategic adaptation of information processing strategy to the task environment. It predicts that increasing information access cost (IAC: the time, and physical and mental effort involved in accessing information) encourages a more memory-intensive strategy. Like interruptions, access costs are also intrinsic to most work environments, such as when opening documents and e-mails. Three experiments investigated whether increasing IAC during a simple copying task can be an effective method for reducing forgetting following interruption. IAC was designated Low (all information permanently visible), Medium (a mouse movement to uncover target information), or High (an additional few seconds to uncover such information). Experiment 1 found that recall improved across all three levels of IAC. Subsequent experiments found that High IAC facilitated resumption after interruption, particularly when interruption occurred on half of all trials (Experiment 2), and improved prospective memory following two different interrupting tasks, even when one involved the disruptive effect of using the same type of resource as the primary task (Experiment 3). The improvement of memory after interruption with increased IAC supports the prediction of the soft constraints hypothesis. The main disadvantage of a high access cost was a reduction in speed of task completion. The practicality of manipulating IAC as a design method for inducing a memory-intensive strategy to protect against forgetting is discussed.},

abstract = {Constraints and dependencies among the elements of embodied cognition form patterns or microstrategies of interactive behavior. Hard constraints determine which microstrategies are possible. Soft constraints determine which of the possible microstrategies are most likely to be selected. When selection is non-deliberate or automatic the least effort microstrategy is chosen. In calculating the effort required to execute a microstrategy each of the three types of operations, memory retrieval, perception, and action, are given equal weight; that is, perceptual-motor activity does not have a privileged status with respect to memory. Soft constraints can work contrary to the designer's intentions by making the access of perfect knowledge in-the-world more effortful than the access of imperfect knowledge in-the-head. These implications of soft constraints are tested in two experiments. In experiment 1 we varied the perceptual-motor effort of accessing knowledge in-the-world as well as the effort of retrieving items from memory. In experiment 2 we replicated one of the experiment 1 conditions to collect eye movement data. The results suggest that milliseconds matter. Soft constraints lead to a reliance on knowledge in-the-head even when the absolute difference in perceptual-motor versus memory retrieval effort is small, and even when relying on memory leads to a higher error rate and lower performance. We discuss the implications of soft constraints for routine interactive behavior, accounts of embodied cognition, and tool and interface design. ?? 2004 Cognitive Science Society, Inc.

abstract = {Text entry rates are explored for several variations of soft keyboards. We present a model to predict novice and expert entry rates and present an empirical test with 24 subjects. Six keyboards were examined: the Qwerty, ABC, Dvorak, Fitaly, JustType, and telephone. At 8-10 wpm, novice predictions are low for all layouts because the dominant factor is the visual scan time, rather than the movement time. Expert predictions are in the range of 22-56 wpm, although these were not tested empirically. In a quick, novice test with a representative phrase of text, subjects achieved rates of 20.2 wpm (Qwerty), 10.7 wpm (ABC), 8.5 wpm (Dvorak), 8.0 wpm (Fitaly), 7.0 wpm (JustType), and 8.0 wpm (telephone). The Qwerty rate of 20.2 wpm is consistent with observations in other studies. The relatively high rate for Qwerty suggests that there is skill transfer from users' familiarity with desktop computers to the stylus tapping task.},

abstract = {Few issues in contemporary risk policy are as momentous or contentious as the precautionary principle. Since it first emerged in German environmental policy, it has been championed by environmentalists and consumer protection groups, and resisted by the industries they oppose (Raffensperger {\&} Tickner, 1999). Various versions of the principle now proliferate across different national and international jurisdictions and policy areas (Fisher, 2002). From a guiding theme in European Commission (EC) environmental policy, it has become a general principle of EC law (CEC, 2000; Vos {\&} Wendler, 2006). Its influence has extended from the regulation of environmental, technological and health risks to the wider governance of science, innovation and trade (O′Riordan {\&} Cameron, 1994).$\backslash$n$\backslash$n{\textgreater} {\ldots} when considering the relative strengths and weaknesses of the precautionary principle, we must also give equal attention to{\ldots} conventional approaches to risk assessment$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAn early classic formulation neatly encapsulates its key features. According to Principle 15 of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development: “In order to protect the environment, the precautionary approach shall be widely applied by States according to their capabilities. Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost‐effective measures to prevent environmental degradation” (UN, 1992). This injunction has given rise to a wide range of criticisms: sound scientific techniques of risk assessment already offer a comprehensive and rational set of ‘decision rules' for use in policy (Byrd {\&} Cothern, 2000); these science‐based approaches yield a robust and practically operational basis for decision‐making under uncertainty (Morris, 2000); the precautionary principle fails as a basis for any similar operational type of decision rule in its own right (Peterson, 2006); the precautionary principle is of practical relevance only in risk management, and not in risk assessment (CEC, 2000 {\ldots}},

This is the question we address in this paper, using the results from a survey of nearly 1600 respondents. This survey was completed by a wide range of spreadsheet users and focused on their significant characteristics and practices. We were interested in their training, experience, collaboration, and quality control methods. We also examined the number of spreadsheet functions they used regularly, the manner in which they created spreadsheets, and the types of tests they used to check results. We compared two subgroups corresponding to two extremes with respect to their self-reported level of experience and skill. Each subgroup was represented by roughly 10{\%} of the total respondents. Our results suggest that there is a substantial difference between these groups, not only in their personal backgrounds and the corporate setting within which they work, but also in their individual spreadsheet skills and practices. We find that the most experienced subgroup exhibits many desirable characteristics and practices. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

={\textgreater} and to identify the practices associated with being a more advanced user; are these good practices?

Main finding
significant differences in practices, often explained by
- training
- experience
- complexity
- importance of spreadsheets in organisation

Gap: most spreadsheet surveys conducted before Excel became dominant software, and not large sample size

Seven-stage model for evolution of spreadsheet
1. designing
2. testing
3. documenting
4. using
5. modifying
6. sharing
7. archiving

Evaluating spreadsheets
Beginners hardly evaluate spreadsheets, advanced users do; but both groups hardly use auditing tools and use more informal techniques

Training
people mostly learn (spreadsheet use) through books{\&}manuals (53.6{\%}) and demonstrations from colleagues (52.3{\%}), less so from formal training (29.2{\%}) due to lack of time

organisations often leave it to the spreadsheet designer to pursue training and employ good practice
what is 'good practice' depends on the context of use of spreadsheet (e.g. size and complexity, degree of sharing)

advanced users
- more often plan design spreadsheets before entering data into computer (e.g. separate data input from formulas)},

abstract = {Currently, there is a controversial debate on whether there is an abstract representation of number magnitude, multiple different ones, or multiple different ones that project onto a unitary representation. The current study aimed at evaluating this issue by means of a magnitude comparison task involving Arabic numbers and structured as well as unstructured non-symbolic patterns of squares. In particular, we were interested whether a specific numerical effect, the unit-decade compatibility effect reflecting decomposed processing of tens and units complying with the place-value structure of the Arabic number system, is affected by input notation. Indeed, a reliable unit-decade compatibility effect was observed in the symbolic-digital notation condition but was absent for unstructured non-symbolic notation. However, for structured non-symbolic notation a - albeit negative - compatibility effect was observed as well. Theses results are hard to reconcile with the notion of an abstract representation of number magnitude. Instead, our data support the existence of multiple representations of numerical magnitude. In addition, the current data indicate that it may not be a question of symbolic vs. non-symbolic notation only but also an issue of the structuring of the input notation. While unstructured non-symbolic quantities seemed to be processed holistically we found evidence suggesting at least partially decomposed processing not only for symbolic Arabic numbers but also for structured non-symbolic quantities.},

abstract = {Six experiments examined the determinants of the numeral advantage effect: the finding that memory span for Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3, etc.) is greater than for digit words (one, two, three, etc.). The speed of item identification for numeral and digit words was unrelated to memory span for the same items and a larger memory span for numerals persisted under concurrent random generation (Experiment 1). The numeral advantage, however, was abolished when the items were presented in random locations within an invisible 3x3x3 grid (Experiment 2) and in locations on a horizontal plane that ran contrary to the natur al direction of reading (Experiment 3). When the items were presented in the same location, a disruption of the spatial component of visuo-spatial working memory eliminated the numeral advantage (Experiment 4), whereas interference with the visual component of the system did not (Experiment 5). When the items were spatially distributed in a 3x3x3 matrix, however, neither visual nor spatial interference abolished the effect (Experiment 6).

abstract = {Interruptions are frequent in many work domains. Researchers in health care have started to study interruptions extensively, but their studies usually do not use a theoretically guided approach. Con-versely, researchers conducting theoretically rich laboratory studies on interruptions have not usually investigated how effectively their findings account for humans working in complex systems such as intensive care units. In the current study, we use the memory for goals theory and prospective memory theory to investigate which properties of an interruption influence how long it takes nurses to resume interrupted critical care tasks. We collected data with a mobile eye tracker in an intensive care unit and developed multiple regression models to predict resumption times. In 55.8{\%} of all interruptions there was a finite—and therefore analyzable—resumption lag. For these cases, the main regression model ex-plained 30.9{\%} (adjusted R 2) of the variance. Longer interruptions (␤ ϭ .36, p Ͻ .001) and changes in physical location due to interruptions (␤ ϭ .40, p Ͻ .001) lengthened the resumption lag. We also calculated regression models on subsets of the data to investigate the generality of the above findings across different situations. In a further 37.6{\%} of all interruptions, nurses used behavioral strategies that greatly diminished or eliminated individual prospective memory demands caused by interruptions, resulting in no analyzable resumption lag. We introduce a descriptive model that accounts for how nurses' behaviors affect the cognitive demand of resuming an interrupted task. Finally, we discuss how the disruptive effects of interruptions in the intensive care unit could be diminished or prevented. In the present study, we use theoretical models of interruptions and prospective memory to investigate factors that might make it easier or harder for people to return to an interrupted task. The potentially disruptive effects of interruptions on cognition are well recognized. Interruptions have been examined in},

Compared to traditional desktop displays, information presented on such systems typically at much wider visual is angles. Additionally, since displays are often placed at different depths or are framed by physical bezels, they introduce physical discontinuities in the presentation of information. In this paper, we describe a study that utilizes a divided attention paradigm to explore the effects of visual separation and physical discontinuities when distributing information across multiple displays. Results show reliable, though small, detrimental effects when information is separated within the visual field, but only when coupled with an offset in depth. Surprisingly, physical discontinuities such as monitor bezels and even separation in depth alone do not seem to affect performance on the set of tasks tested. Following the findings, we provide recommendations for the design of hardware and software in multiple display environments.},

abstract = {SearchUser Interfaces (SUIs) represent the gateway between peoplewhohave a task to complete,and the repositories of information and data stored around the world.Not surprisingly, therefore, there are many communities who have a vested interest in the way SUIs are designed. There are people who study how humans search for information, and people who study how humans use computers. There are people who study good user interface design, and people who design aesthetically pleasing user interfaces. There are also people who curate and manage valuable information resources, and people who design effective algorithms to retrieve results from them.While it would be easy for one community to reject another for their limited ability to design a good SUI, the truth is that they all can, and they all have made valuable contributions. Fundamentally, therefore, we must accept that designing a great SUI means leveraging the knowledge and skills from all of these communities. Theaim of this book is to at least acknowledge, if not integrate,all of these perspectives to bring the reader into amultidisciplinary mindset for how we should think about SUI design. Further, this book aims to provide the reader with a framework for thinking about howdifferent innovations each contribute to the overall design of a SUI.With this framework and amultidisciplinary perspective in hand, the book then continues by reviewing: early, successful, established, and experimental concepts for SUI design. The book then concludes by discussing how we can analyse and evaluate the on- going developments in SUI design, as thismultidisciplinary area of researchmoves forwards.Finally, in reviewing these many SUIs and SUI features, the book finishes by extracting a series of 20 SUI design recommendations that are listed in the conclusions.},

These lawyers chose to rely primarily on one major digital law library for legal information seeking. Their preference was often based upon vague or flawed rationale and suggests the need for academic lawyers to appreciate the situations in which different electronic resources might be useful (between-systems knowledge).},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to investigate the nature and causes of human errors in the intensive care unit (ICU), adopting approaches proposed by human factors engineering. The basic assumption was that errors occur and follow a pattern that can be uncovered. DESIGN: Concurrent incident study. SETTING: Medical-surgical ICU of a university hospital. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Two types of data were collected: errors reported by physicians and nurses immediately after an error discovery; and activity profiles based on 24-hr records taken by observers with human engineering experience on a sample of patients. During the 4 months of data collection, a total of 554 human errors were reported by the medical staff. Errors were rated for severity and classified according to the body system and type of medical activity involved. There was an average of 178 activities per patient per day and an estimated number of 1.7 errors per patient per day. For the ICU as a whole, a severe or potentially detrimental error occurred on the average twice a day. Physicians and nurses were about equal contributors to the number of errors, although nurses had many more activities per day. CONCLUSIONS: A significant number of dangerous human errors occur in the ICU. Many of these errors could be attributed to problems of communication between the physicians and nurses. Applying human factor engineering concepts to the study of the weak points of a specific ICU may help to reduce the number of errors. Errors should not be considered as an incurable disease, but rather as preventable phenomena.},

To accommodate the users of spreadsheet languages, we provide an interface to our methodology that does not require an understanding of testing theory.

We report on the methodology, its time and space costs, and the mapping from the testing strategy to the user interface.

This research investigates four categories of device users via a survey with 383 respondents, in the context of search behaviour and information sources used. The results reveal that search engines and family and friends are the most frequently used information sources while the personal computer (PC) is the most used device for both searching and booking. However, there is a significant difference in how these device users engage with information sources, specifically online travel agents (OTAs) and search engines. Furthermore, device users favour one device and are unlikely to switch devices during the search process.},

Furthermore, in thier model they assumed people could only correct a number by using the backspace, which meant that the longer people would wait to check, the more time would be required to correct a digit if it turned out to be wrong.
This is often not the case in real life, where a cursor can be used to select the digit/number that has to be corrected.},

To advance an understanding of the ways users benefit from, are challenged by, and abandon smart devices, we asked a group of users to purchase smart sensing devices to advance themselves towards a personal, self-defined goal. We found that participants abandoned devices because they did not fit with the their conceptions of themselves, the data collected by devices were perceived to not be useful, and device maintenance became unmanageable. Participants used devices because they had developed routines and because devices were useful, satisfied curiosity, and held hope for potential benefit to them. We propose ways to reduce barriers, motivate use, and argue for envisioning an additional function of these devices for short-term interventions, in addition to standard long-term use.},

Thirty-two medical residents participated in a simulated experiment, where they studied four patient cases and later on completed recall and recognition questions.

Further, when information access cost is high, overconfidence leads to poorer pre-handover performance.},
annote = {Increase in IAC encourages memory-intensive strategy
people often rely on memory-intensive strategy in healthcare which is prone to errors

previous lit: memory-intensive threat to accuracy
gap: lack of empirical research that addresses the underlying reasons an quantifies potential negative impacts
aim: examine the factors influencing medical residents' information retrieval strategy and performance

Two factors
1. speed-accuracy trade-off
2. Accountability

Hypotheses: 
IAC will reduce visits
Accountability will increase visits and duration and improve accuracy

Two studies
1. Semi-structured interviews
2. simulation-based experiment

Semi-structured interview
- no handover preparation protocol, information strategy varied across participants
- 13 participants checked external information, 8 relied on memory-intensive strategies
={\textgreater} revealed use of different information retrieval strategies

Experiment
2x2 within-subjects
accountability: low (performance confidential); high (performance would be assessed)
IAC: low (available on same PC); high (other PC 5m away)
1. participant studied four patient cases for 150s each; after that, accountability for 1 participant announced
2. Test 1 (memory and confidence): answered recognition/recall question based on memory, provided confidence estimates
3. Test 2 (number and duration of accesses): allowed to access case; either next to desk or 5m away

choice of IAC manipulation: determined by research sites; large portion paper-based at various physical places

Results
- accountability increased memory accuracy
- accountability reduced overconfidence but no effect on confidence
- IAC decreased access attempts and duration
- IAC decreased performance
- accountability almost had effect on duration, no effect on attempts
- no effect of accountability on performance when IAC is low but does when IAC is high

Discussion
- revealed that people relied largely on memory; hypothesised this was due to IAC and accountability
- showed that physical distance is viable way of inducing varied IAC

Limitations
- interaction with patient in real setting often takes place with additional auditory/tactile channels and last for longer
- experiment focused on accuracy, but preparation is also about other activities such as which information to include
- IAC only manipulated one way but can be affected by other factors
- participants were junior residents
- experiment assumed KIW was perfect, whereas in the real world these may contain errors
- limited availability of participants, so insufficient statistical power},

Aviation, aeronautics, and product manufacturing have come to rely heavily on checklists to aid in reducing human error. The checklist is an important tool in error management across all these fields, contributing significantly to reductions in the risk of costly mistakes and improving overall outcomes. Such benefits also translate to improving the delivery of patient care. Despite demonstrated benefits of checklists in medicine and critical care, the integration of checklists into practice has not been as rapid and widespread as with other fields.

We take the reverse perspective and examine whether one might first be in an attentional state that makes one susceptible to communications typically associated with distraction. We explore the confluence of multitasking and workplace communications from three temporal perspectives – prior to an interaction, when tasks and communications are interleaved, and at the end of the day. Using logging techniques and experience sampling, we observed 32 employees in situ for five days. We found that certain attentional states lead people to be more susceptible to particular types of interaction. Rote work is followed by more Facebook or face-to-face interaction. Focused and aroused states are followed by more email. The more time in email and face-fo-face interaction, and the more total screen switches, the less productive people feel at the day's end. We present the notion of emotional homeostasis along with new directions for multitasking research.},

Results show that the models detect breakpoints reasonably well, but struggle to differentiate their type. Our second study explored effects of managing notifications with our system on users and their tasks. Results showed that scheduling notifications at breakpoints reduces frustration and reaction time relative to delivering them immediately. We also found that the relevance of notification content determines the type of breakpoint at which it should be delivered. The core concept of scheduling notifications at breakpoints fits well with how users prefer notifications to be managed.

Our first study demonstrates that simply increasing the physical demands of the game by requiring gamers to interact more with the game does not result in increased immersion. In a further two studies, we use time pressure to make games more physically and cognitively challenging. We find that the addition of time pressure increases immersion as predicted.

While having multiple devices provides new opportunities to work in the face of changing resource deprivations, the management of devices is often problematic. The most salient problems are posed by 1) the physical effort demanded by various management tasks, 2) anticipating what data or functionality will be needed, and 3) aligning these efforts with work, mobility, and social situations. Workers' strategies of coping with these problems center on two interwoven activities: the physical handling of devices and cross-device synchroniza- tion. These aim at balancing risk and effort in immediate and subsequent use. Workers also exhibit subtle ways to handle devices in situ, appropriating their physical and op- erational properties. The design implications are discussed.},

It approaches this task by proposing that theories – when viewed as conceptual tools formaking sense of a domain – have four important attributes: descriptivepower; rhetorical power; inferential power; and application power.It observes that AT and DCOG are not so different: both emphasizecognition; both include the social and cultural context of cognition;both share a commitment to ethnographically collected data. Startingwith a description of the distributed cognition approach, it uses anexample of a DCOG analysis to ground a discussion of the strengths andweaknesses of AT and DCOG as an approach to issues in CSCW. Finally,the essay considers what theoretical work is being done by theattributes of the respective theories, and whether AT, DCOG, or anytheory developed outside the context of group work, will workfor CSCW.

abstract = {Short-Term Memory (STM) 119 T o a large degree, our sense of who we are depends upon what we know, and what we know depends upon our ability to remember what we have learned. Learning is defined as the permanent change in behavior that results from experience. But this learned information must be stored within us in order to be retrieved later. This process of storage is memory: the mecha-nism that allows us to retain and retrieve information over time. Memory is an essential, underlying, cognitive process that supports learning and makes it possible for us to acquire new knowledge and remember new information as we encounter new situations. This chapter and the three that follow comprise a unit that describes the different memory mechanisms we all possess, and how what we know helps us to learn more and function effectively. A major goal of this unit is to explain some of the subtleties and complexi-ties lurking just below the surface of the memory processes that we generally take for granted. We begin by describing what has been called short-term memory (STM), the memory that contains our moment-to-moment con-scious thoughts and perceptions. Short-term memory is fleeting: Its contents endure only as long as we are paying attention to them. Psychologists have historically found it easy to do research on the nature and limits of STM because people have immediate experience of its presence. In contrast, we have less awareness of working memory (WM): the set of mechanisms that underlies STM and also communicates with long-term memory (LTM), the semipermanent memory store that endures for a lifetime and aids us in learn-ing new information. LTM will be the focus of Chapters 6–8. In this chapter we will discuss STM and its structural support, WM. Short-Term Memory (STM) Short-term memory reflects our conscious awareness. We rely on STM as we carry out everyday activities like remembering a phone number long enough to call it, remembering the play signaled by the third-base " You have to begin to lose your memory, if only in bits and pieces, to realize that},

With specific use of the framework we identify and describe six resilience episodes that impacted on the potential for error in the system. The framework's focus and elements allowed us to explore the details of these resilience episodes. This analysis demonstrates the framework's utility in facilitating an empirical resilience analysis.

abstract = {Background Surgery has become an integral part of global health care, with an estimated 234 million operations performed yearly. Surgical complications are common and often preventable. We hypothesized that a program to implement a 19-item surgical safety checklist designed to improve team communication and consistency of care would reduce complications and deaths associated with surgery. Methods Between October 2007 and September 2008, eight hospitals in eight cities (Toronto, Canada; New Delhi, India; Amman, Jordan; Auckland, New Zealand; Manila, Philippines; Ifakara, Tanzania; London, England; and Seattle, WA) representing a variety of economic circumstances and diverse populations of patients participated in the World Health Organization's Safe Surgery Saves Lives program. We prospectively collected data on clinical processes and outcomes from 3733 consecutively enrolled patients 16 years of age or older who were undergoing noncardiac surgery. We subsequently collected data on 3955 consecutively enrolled patients after the introduction of the Surgical Safety Checklist. The primary end point was the rate of complications, including death, during hospitalization within the first 30 days after the operation. Results The rate of death was 1.5{\%} before the checklist was introduced and declined to 0.8{\%} afterward (P=0.003). Inpatient complications occurred in 11.0{\%} of patients at baseline and in 7.0{\%} after introduction of the checklist (P{\textless}0.001). Conclusions Implementation of the checklist was associated with concomitant reductions in the rates of death and complications among patients at least 16 years of age who were undergoing noncardiac surgery in a diverse group of hospitals.},

abstract = {We explored general issues concerning personal information management by investigating the characteristics of office workers' paper-based information, in an industrial research environment. We examined the reasons people collect paper, types of data they collect, problems encountered in handling paper, and strategies used for processing it. We tested three specific hypotheses in the course of an office move. The greater availability of public digital data along with changes in people's jobs or interests should lead to wholescale discarding of paper data, while preparing for the move. Instead we found workers kept large, highly valued paper archives. We also expected that the major part of people's personal archives would be unique documents. However, only 49{\%} of people's archives were unique documents, the remainder being copies of publicly available data and unread information, and we explore reasons for this. We examined the effects of paper-processing strategies on archive structure. We discovered different paper-processing strategies (filing and piling) that were relatively independent of job type. We predicted that filers' attempts to evaluate and categorize incoming documents would produce smaller archives that were accessed frequently. Contrary to our predictions, filers amassed more information, and accessed it less frequently than pilers. We argue that filers may engage in premature filing: to clear their workspace, they archive information that later turns out to be of low value. Given the effort involved in organizing data, they are also loath to discard filed information, even when its value is uncertain. We discuss the implications of this research for digital personal information management.},

We explore instead how multitasking might be influenced by individual factors: personality, stress, and sleep. Forty information workers' online activity was tracked over two work weeks. The median duration of online screen focus was 40 seconds. The personality trait of Neuroticism was associated with shorter online focus duration and Impulsivity-Urgency was associated with longer online focus duration. Stress and sleep duration showed trends to be inversely associated with online focus. Shorter focus duration was associated with lower assessed productivity at day's end. Factor analysis revealed a factor of lack of control which significantly predicts multitasking. Our results suggest that there could be a trait for distractibility where some individuals are susceptible to online attention shifting in the workplace. Our results have implications for information systems (e.g. educational systems, game design) where attention focus is key.},

abstract = {Organizations routinely implement preventive controls (e.g., segregation of duties, physical control over assets, etc.) and detective controls (e.g., performance reviews, reconciliations, inventory counts, period audits, etc.) to mitigate risk and to achieve organizational objectives. Yet very little is known about why each formal control type is effective. Importantly, organizations generally can choose to implement either preventive or detective controls to address the same control objective. Therefore, understanding the costs and benefits of control types is critical. To understand the impact of preventive and detective controls on employees' performance and intrinsic motivation, we examine two specific attributes: (a) the extent to which controls restrict employees' autonomy and (b) the timeliness of control feedback. We conduct an experiment using an incomplete contract setting in which one dimension of the employees' task is compensated and one dimension is controlled. The results show that detective controls with timely feedback improve employees' performance toward the control objective, without diminishing their intrinsic motivation. In contrast, the restriction of autonomy associated with preventive controls does not improve employees' performance toward the control objective relative to detective controls with timely feedback, but significantly reduces employees' motivation. Neither control attribute diminishes employees' performance on the compensated dimension of the task, suggesting that the monetary incentives in the contract continue to provide effective motivation. Our results reveal the importance of designing and implementing controls that provide timely feedback but do not restrict autonomy. Specifically, the results suggest that organizations can achieve their control objectives without hampering employee motivation by implementing detective controls with timely feedback.},

abstract = {Everyday multitasking with electronic devices is common among all age groups, but the youngest generations of persons carry out the most everyday multitasking, especially in the form of media multitasking. Multitasking via technology in school settings or at home while study-ing is common for students. Both external factors (e.g., alerts from smartphones) and internal factors (e.g., thoughts about future online activities) influence multitasking prevalence. Although laboratory re-search has shown that performing concurrent tasks is subject to processing bottlenecks and to switch costs, real-life everyday multi-tasking is different from laboratory dual-task scenarios in several ways, including having more than two tasks involved, proceeding by inter-leaving tasks over extended periods of time, and allowing more flexibility in resource allocation and setting of priorities. Theoretically, everyday multitasking should be capable of achieving some processing efficien-cies. Yet, empirical research shows that studying, doing homework, learning during lectures, learning from other sources, grades, and GPA likely are all negatively affected by concurrent multitasking with tech-nology. Young people who frequently multitask compared with other young people may be poorer at ignoring irrelevant environmental in-formation, but the effects of extreme multitasking on other cognitive outcomes are not clear-cut. There are strategies that people of all ages can use to minimize multitasking and reduce distractions when they are performing important tasks such as studying or doing homework.},

In an ethnographic study, we investigated the phenomenon of communication chains, the occurrence of interactions in quick succession. Focusing on chains enable us to better understand the role of communication in multitasking. Our results reveal that chains are prevalent in information workers, and that attributes such as the number of links, and the rate of media and organizational switching can be predicted from the first catalyzing link of the chain. When chains are triggered by external interruptions, they have more links, a trend for more media switches and more organizational switches. We also found that more switching of organizational contexts in communication is associated with higher levels of stress. We describe the role of communication chains as performing alignment in multitasking and discuss the implications of our results.},

abstract = {Taking notes on laptops rather than in longhand is increasingly common. Many researchers have suggested that laptop note taking is less effective than longhand note taking for learning. Prior studies have primarily focused on students' capacity for multitasking and distraction when using laptops. The present research suggests that even when laptops are used solely to take notes, they may still be impairing learning because their use results in shallower processing. In three studies, we found that students who took notes on laptops performed worse on conceptual questions than students who took notes longhand. We show that whereas taking more notes can be beneficial, laptop note takers' tendency to transcribe lectures verbatim rather than processing information and reframing it in their own words is detrimental to learning.},
annote = {contribution: 3 experiments to investigate whether taking notes on a laptop versus writing longhand affects academic performance, and to explore the potential mechanism of verbatim overlap as a proxy for depth of processing

laptop users may not be encoding as much information, but they do record significantly more content (albeit verbatim)

Study 1: let participants watch TED talk, make notes either by writing or on laptop, let them do distractor tasks, then test them
Result: on factual questions no difference, on conceptual questions writing sign. better
- wrote more on laptop
- those who wrote more notes performed better, but those with less verbatim overlap also performed better

Study 2: explicitly instruct participants to not transcribe verbatim

Study 3: tested after a week, when students have had opportunity to study notes
- long-hand and study superior; but when no study no difference between mediums; might be because of difficulty questions

General results
- participants using laptops more inclined to take verbatim notes, thus hurting learning
- laptop users may write more (thus richer exernal storage), but engage in more shallow processing and encoding
- telling students not take verbatim notes did not prevent this behaviour
- longhand note takers may engage in more processing, selecting more important information to include, which enables them to study this content more efficiently},

abstract = {The continuing trend toward greater processing power, larger storage, and in particular increased display surface by using multiple monitor supports increased multi-tasking by the computer user. The concomitant increase in desktop complexity has the potential to push the overhead of window management to frustrating and counterproductive new levels. It is difficult to adequately design for multiple monitor systems without understanding how multiple monitor users differ from, or are similar to, single monitor users. Therefore, we deployed a tool to a group of single monitor and multiple monitor users to log window management activity. Analysis of the data collected from this tool revealed that usage of interaction components may change with an increase in number of monitors, and window visibility can be a useful measure of user display space management activity, especially for multiple monitor users. The results from this analysis begin to fill a gap in research about real-world window management practices.},

- error rate increased significantly when interruptions

- the task interface does not provide explicit cues to aid successful resumption, so people have to remember where they were in the task sequence- the interrupting task has high cognitive load which limits users in rehearsing the goal of primary task during interruption
Method:
- doughnut order had to be filled in specific sequence
- after completing it in one compartment, input would be erased so user would not have a cue what had been done 
High-cost: 10 second delay and have to start over
Low-cost: audible beep and correct component was named

- what if they made an error that was not after an interruption
- what if they made an error in the Packing task?


- the results of the study "support the idea that encouraging users to adopt a memory-intensive strategy, for instance by taking the time to plan their actions before executing them, can facilitate resumption behaviour and reduce the likelihood of error"


Morgan et al. (2009): if the access to information is difficult, more of the information is encoded into memory meaning that it did not have to be re-checked
downside is that it might slow users down in completing their work


explanation why resumption lockout reduced errors (which is in contrast with memory for goals theory)

2) "perceptual re-encoding of the interface that might occur during resumption period"

abstract = {Reinforcement learning approaches to cognitive modeling represent task acquisition as learning to choose the sequence of steps that accomplishes the task while maximizing a reward. However, an apparently unrecognized problem for modelers is choosing when, what, and how much to reward; that is, when (the moment: end of trial, subtask, or some other interval of task performance), what (the objective function: e.g., performance time or performance accuracy), and how much (the magnitude: with binary, categorical, or continuous values). In this article, we explore the problem space of these three parameters in the context of a task whose completion entails some combination of 36 state-action pairs, where all intermediate states (i.e., after the initial state and prior to the end state) represent progressive but partial completion of the task. Different choices produce profoundly different learning paths and outcomes, with the strongest effect for moment. Unfortunately, there is little discussion in the literature of the effect of such choices. This absence is disappointing, as the choice of when, what, and how much needs to be made by a modeler for every learning model.},

abstract = {Large wall-sized displays are becoming prevalent. Although researchers have articulated qualitative benefits of group work on large displays, little work has been done to quantify the benefits for individual users. In this article we present four experiments comparing the performance of users working on a large projected wall display to that of users working on a standard desktop monitor. In these experiments, we held the visual angle constant by adjusting the viewing distance to each of the displays. Results from the first two experiments suggest that physically large displays, even when viewed at identical visual angles as smaller ones, help users perform better on mental rotation tasks. We show through the experiments how these results may be attributed, at least in part, to large displays immersing users within the problem space and biasing them into using more efficient cognitive strategies. In the latter two experiments, we extend these results, showing the presence of these effects with more complex tasks, such as 3D navigation and mental map formation and memory. Results further show that the effects of physical display size are independent of other factors that may induce immersion, such as interactivity and mental aids within the virtual environments. We conclude with a general discussion of the findings and possibilities for future work.},

abstract = {As healthcare shifts from the hospital to the home, it is becoming increasingly important to understand how patients interact with home medical devices, to inform the safe and patient-friendly design of these devices. Distributed Cognition (DCog) has been a useful theoretical framework for understanding situated interactions in the healthcare domain. However, it has not previously been applied to study interactions with home medical devices. In this study, DCog was applied to understand renal patients' interactions with Home Hemodialysis Technology (HHT), as an example of a home medical device. Data was gathered through ethnographic observations and interviews with 19 renal patients and interviews with seven professionals. Data was analyzed through the principles summarized in the Distributed Cognition for Teamwork methodology. In this paper we focus on the analysis of system activities, information flows, social structures, physical layouts, and artefacts. By explicitly considering different ways in which cognitive processes are distributed, the DCog approach helped to understand patients' interaction strategies, and pointed to design opportunities that could improve patients' experiences of using HHT. The findings highlight the need to design HHT taking into consideration likely scenarios of use in the home and of the broader home context. A setting such as home hemodialysis has the characteristics of a complex and safety-critical socio-technical system, and a DCog approach effectively helps to understand how safety is achieved or compromised in such a system.},

- visual cues effective in directing behaviour in routine tasks
- some interface features are more salient en attract attention, probe certain behaviour
2. some steps in procedure better learnt or practiced than others

3. some steps seem more relevant than others
- device-oriented step: selecting text entry box (less relevant)

hypothesis: "the difference between device- and task-oriented steps is a distinction in the way that tasks are organised in the head, not just a feature of how designers organise interfaces"

abstract = {Information-seeking is important for lawyers, who have access to many dedicated electronic resources. However there is considerable scope for improving the design of these resources to better support information-seeking. One way of informing design is to use information-seeking models as theoretical lenses to analyse users' behaviour with existing systems. However many models, including those informed by studying lawyers, analyse information-seeking at a high level of abstraction and are only likely to lead to broad-scoped design insights. We illustrate that one potentially useful (and lower-level) model is Ellis's - by using it as a lens to analyse and make design suggestions based on the information-seeking behaviour of 27 academic lawyers, who were asked to think aloud whilst using electronic legal resources to find information for their work. We identify similar information-seeking behaviours to those originally found by Ellis and his colleagues in scientific domains, along with several that were not identified in previous studies such as 'updating' (which we believe is particularly pertinent to legal information-seeking). We also present a refinement of Ellis's model based on the identification of several levels that the behaviours were found to operate at and the identification of sets of mutually exclusive subtypes of behaviours. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper reports a series of studies into whether personal informatics (PI) tools for productivity can make people more aware of their SNS usage and encourage behaviour change. The first two studies took an in-the-wild approach, encouraging students to use a PI tool, RescueTime, to improve their estimations of how much time they spent using SNS, in line with research that had used this technique to reduce However, participants simply did not engage with RescueTime in the studies. A further interview study found that there are four barriers that inhibit engagement with this PI tool and reduce its potential to facilitate behaviour change. In particular, the way it presents data lacks: salience; contextual information; credibility; and action advice. INTRODUCTION The ubiquity of modern technologies has revolutionised how people complete daily tasks. Individuals are more reliant on computers than ever before, and while this has made a number of activities easier and quicker, it has also increased the opportunities for interruption. Not only can individuals be actively notified of incoming information in the form of e-mails and instant messages, but they also have easy access to a number of other sources of distraction. While in some workplaces, internet access may be restricted or monitored, thus removing the temptation to access distractions such as social networking sites (SNS), this is not the case for students. Like knowledge workers, their productivity relies heavily on their own time management and therefore distractions by anything deemed to be unproductive may be especially stressful.},

Visual cues include five types of frames and mask around the target window and four trails leading to the window. We report the results of two user studies. The first evaluates each cue in isolation. The second evaluates hybrid techniques created by combining the most successful candidates from the first study.

Humans organize work and leisure in more or less well defined tasks and activities. Computers organize computing in terms of applications, files, networks, etc. This abstraction gap becomes a big problem in situations characterized by mobility, frequent interruptions, and collaboration – situations that pervasive computing is intended to support. A new paradigm, task-level or activity-based computing, has been proposed to lessen the abstraction gap and provide a better platform for pervasive computing. In this paper, we shortly describe our approach to activity-based computing and describe lessons learned so far, including discussing some of the more tricky open issues which has surfaced in our research},

We use this extension to model visual distraction in two experiments. The model provides explanations for the finding that distraction increases with task difficulty in a memory task, but decreases with task difficulty in a visual search task},

A user who finds a recognition error can simply select the correct word from the candidates for that temporal region. In order to overcome the difficulty of generating appropriate candidates, we adopted a confusion network that can condense a huge internal word graph of a large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) system.

It differs from dual task paradigms in that tasks are performed not in parallel, but by interleaving, switching from one to the other. It differs also from task switching paradigms in that the time scale is very much longer, multiple different tasks are involved, and most tasks have a clear end point. Multitasking has been studied extensively with particular sets of experts such as in aviation and in the military, and impairments of multitasking performance have been studied in patients with frontal lobe lesions. Much less is known as to how multitasking is achieved in healthy adults who have not had specific training in the necessary skills. This paper will provide a brief review of research on everyday multitasking, and summarise the results of some recent experiments on simulated everyday tasks chosen to require advance and on-line planning, retrospective memory, prospective memory, and visual, spatial and verbal short-term memory.},

Menu method: engage in menu-based dialogue to specify order of entry first, but after that can simply type next number by clicking RETURN; after set-up only keyboard interaction needed
no-choice phase: both methods used (four trials)
choice-phase: user can choose which method (two trials)
data about performance: i.e. time taken to enter numbers using each method
data about preference: i.e. which method is chosen

- half could be entered more quickly with menu method, rest more quickly with mouse method

Mouse method:
- time is determined by 4.19 x number of lines x number of cells per line

Menu method:
- time determined by intial setup time (18.93s), time to initiate each line (2.81s) x number of lines , time to type number into each cell (2.46) x number of cells

People choose Menu method more often (even when Mouse would be faster)
Obvious explanations: 1) people are unable to estimate the time it takes, 2) users prepared to trade off fixed amount of time against greater perceived effort of mouse method

As a result, there is value in understanding how to design technology so that gains are realized from desired interruptions, while the losses from unwanted interruptions are minimized. This paper presents the findings of two complementary field studies, one quantitative and the other qualitative, exploring how the provision of additional incoming cell phone call information impacts people's interruption decision making. These studies were enabled by, Telling Calls, a research application built to enable users to provide and receive information such as what the call is about and the caller's circumstances. The qualitative study showed how the additional call information helps people make informed call handling decisions and acts as an aid to effective conversation. The quantitative study elucidated these findings and showed that reducing the uncertainty about the nature of an incoming call improves people's ability to predict the value of an interruption. By combining these diverse research approaches: (1) theory instantiation through tool building; (2) context-aware surveys; and (3) semi-structured interviews, we were able to gain unique insights into the nature of interruption management in the wild, and related design implications.},

annote = {- we draw together main insights from behavioural neuroscience of self-regulation
- we use resulting model to frame self-regulation struggles related to ICT use
- we use model to analyse a simple of existing anti-distraction tools

Lyng has used to explain some of the mechanisms of self-regulating ICT use. 

Lyng explains that a common difficulty in self-regulating ICT use is that users may have certain goals, but at the time of action, these goals are either not strongly enough represented in working memory to regulate behaviour, or the expected value of meeting these goals is too low. In our study, we clearly saw the latter: people were aware of the disruptiveness of interruptions, and did effecitvely manage some. However, in some cases, the expected value of deferring these was too low to control their interruption behaviour. Giving users explicit information about the value of control, or rather the harm of no control, may make them more able to manage them. 

In Lyngs model on 
The permanent access to technology makes it difficult for users to self-regulate ICT use []. 

Viewing struggles with self-regulation of ICT use through this lens yields the following perspective on its meaning, causes, and related design features:
1. the meaning of self-regulatory difficulties is that conscious, System 2-level processing perceive a mismatch between one's past or current ICT use and one's reflective usage goals

2. the general cause of such mismatch is that System 1-level behaviour control is not aligned with one's reflective usage goals, and that those usage goals are either not represented in working memory at the time of action, or the expected value of control is too low to generate top-down biases strong enough to cause the desired action schemas to control behaviour

3. default design of smartphones and laptops tends to give users instant and permanent access to most functionality

From 31 observations of pump programming we note 10 low-level disturbances, which we conceptualise in terms of unremarkable error. This data supports a view that well performing systems cope with error as part of their normal work. Users are able to recover from error and are resilient to performance deviations. However, it is not clear how we, as HCI researchers, should respond to these minor errors: should we aim to minimise them or instead aim to improve detection, recovery and control in safety-critical systems? What is clear is that without remarking on unremarkable error we cannot begin this dialogue and consider the handling of these issues. To conclude we recognise four important factors that influence remedial action, and we highlight the need for a socio-technical approach for making change that is appropriate for practice.},

For this reason understanding users' error checking behavior is highly important. One aspect that can affect error checking is the interface that a user must interact with to enter data. Often user interaction with interfaces is evaluated based on speed or error rate. In this paper, in addition to this, we also explore how different types of interface can affect a user's error checking behavior in a multitasking environment. We show that a fast to use and familiar interface discourages users from carrying out thorough visual checking in a number transcription task. We also found that having participants perform an additional secondary task while doing the number entry task made participants less likely to check the inputted numbers for errors.},

In a paired difference experiment using apartment selection tasks and gambles, we found significant differences in information search patterns and subsequent choice behavior contingent upon the process tracing method. Overall, computerized process tracing tools increase the amount of effort needed to acquire information compared with eye tracking equipment. Our results show that subjects adopt information acquisition strategies to cope with the increased effort. These strategies tend to be more rigorous and systematic than those observed with eye tracking equipment. Thus, computerized process tracing tools fundamentally alter the information processing behavior they are believed to track unobtrusively by limiting the ability of the decision maker to adapt their information processing behavior dynamically to the demands of the data. Additional research is needed to explore the magnitude and consequences of these differences},

This paper compared the effectiveness of three data checking methods - double entry, read aloud, and visual checking - using the types of data and data entry personnel that are typically used in psychological research. To compare these techniques, we created 20 data sheets and entered them into the computer. Next, we deliberately introduced errors into this data set. Participants' job was to locate and correct these errors. A total of 340 undergraduates participated in this study. Of these, 80 had previous data entry experience and 260 did not. Double entry was far superior to read aloud and visual checking, both among people with previous data entry experience and among people without previous experience. Among people with no previous experience, read aloud and visual checking had more than 20 times as many errors as double entry. In addition, double entry was preferred over visual checking. Thus, although double entry takes slightly longer, it is clearly worth the extra effort. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.All rights reserved .},

abstract = {Recent research findings in the domain of transcription typing are reviewed in the context of a four- component heuristic model. The four components consist of an input phase in which to-be-typed text is grouped into familiar chunks, a parsing phase in which the chunks are decomposed into discrete characters, a translation phase in which characters are converted into movement specifications, and finally an execution phase in which the actual movements are produced. This framework was used to integrate 29 distinct empirical phenomena related to transcription typing, including the multiple units of typing, the existence of four major categories of errors, and differences associated with i ncreasi ng skill. The review concludes with a brief discussion of several issues that appear to provide promising directions for future research.},

Despite the fact that paper documents still form a significant part of our daily working activities, existing PIM systems usually support the organisation and re-finding of digital documents only. While physical document tracking solutions such as RFID- or computer vision-based systems are recently gaining some attention, they usually focus on the paper document tracking and offer limited support for re-finding activities. We present PimVis, a solution for exploring and re-finding digital and paper documents in so-called cross-media information spaces. The PimVis user interface enables a unified organisation of digital and paper documents through the creation of bidirectional links between the digital and physical information space. The presented personal cross-media information management solution further supports the extension with alternative document tracking techniques as well as augmented reality solutions. A formative PimVis evaluation revealed the high potential of fully integrated cross-media PIM solutions.},

abstract = {Self-interruptions account for a significant portion of task switching in information-centric work contexts. However, most of the research to date has focused on understanding, analyzing and designing for external interruptions. The causes of self-interruptions are not well understood. In this paper we present an analysis of 889 hours of observed task switching behavior from 36 individuals across three high-technology information work organizations. Our analysis suggests that self-interruption is a function of organizational environment and individual differences, but also external interruptions experienced. We find that people in open office environments interrupt themselves at a higher rate. We also find that people are significantly more likely to interrupt themselves to return to solitary work associated with central working spheres, suggesting that self-interruption occurs largely as a function of prospective memory events. The research presented contributes substantially to our understanding of attention and multitasking in context.},

Experiment 1 showed a significant main effect of interruption position on PCE rate; significantly more PCEs were obtained when the interruption occurred just before the PC step than interruptions at any other positions in the task. The same effect was also obtained for other non-PCEs suggesting that PCEs are no different to other non-PCEs in terms of the interruption position effect. Experiment 2 replicated the interruption position effect but did not show a reliable difference in PCE rates between a 45-sec and a 15-sec interruption. However, the trend of the differences in PCE rates between the two interruption durations is consistent with our initial prediction. The results of both experiments were explained in terms of the activation-based goal memory model (Altmann {\&} Trafton, 2002).},

First, the system provides a unified index of information that a person has seen, whether it was seen as email, web page, document, appointment, etc. Second, because the information has been seen before, rich contextual cues can be used in the search interface. The system has been used internally by more than 230 employees. We report on both qualitative and quantitative aspects of system use. Initial findings show that time and people are important retrieval cues. Users find information more easily using SIS, and use other search tools less frequently after installation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Tenfold medication errors are a significant source of risk to pediatric patients. This may be because of wide variations in age, weight, dosing ranges, and off-label practices, but few studies exclusively devoted to examining pediatric 10-fold error have identified the circumstances and mechanisms that lead to such errors. We examined all 10-fold medication errors reported within an academic, university-affiliated pediatric hospital to make recommendations for future initiatives that could improve medication safety in pediatric practice. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated all medication-related incident reports submitted to a voluntary safety-reporting database over a 5-year period for reports describing 10-fold medication error. Main outcome measures comprised severity of error, drugs and drug classes involved, 10-fold medication error enablers, mechanisms, and contributing causes. RESULTS: From 6643 medication-related safety reports, 252 10-fold medication errors were identified at a mean reporting rate of 0.062 per 100 total patient days. Morphine was the most frequently reported medication, and opioids were the most frequently reported drug class. Twenty-two reports described patient harm. Intravenous formulations, paper ordering, and drug-delivery pumps were frequent error enablers. Errors of dose calculation, documentation of decimal points, and confusion with zeroes were frequent contributing causes to 10-fold medication error. CONCLUSIONS: This study exclusively and comprehensively examined 10-fold medication errors over a prolonged time in pediatric inpatients. We discuss recommendations of vigilance for specific drugs and standardized order sets for opioids and antibiotics, and identify the administering phase of the medication process as a high-risk practice that can result in pediatric 10-fold medication error.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Interruptions have been implicated as a cause of clinical errors, yet, to our knowledge, no empirical studies of this relationship exist. We tested the hypothesis that interruptions during medication administration increase errors.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We performed an observational study of nurses preparing and administering medications in 6 wards at 2 major teaching hospitals in Sydney, Australia. Procedural failures and interruptions were recorded during direct observation. Clinical errors were identified by comparing observational data with patients' medication charts. A volunteer sample of 98 nurses (representing a participation rate of 82{\%}) were observed preparing and administering 4271 medications to 720 patients over 505 hours from September 2006 through March 2008. Associations between procedural failures (10 indicators; eg, aseptic technique) and clinical errors (12 indicators; eg, wrong dose) and interruptions, and between interruptions and potential severity of failures and errors, were the main outcome measures.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Each interruption was associated with a 12.1{\%} increase in procedural failures and a 12.7{\%} increase in clinical errors. The association between interruptions and clinical errors was independent of hospital and nurse characteristics. Interruptions occurred in 53.1{\%} of administrations (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 51.6{\%}-54.6{\%}). Of total drug administrations, 74.4{\%} (n = 3177) had at least 1 procedural failure (95{\%} CI, 73.1{\%}-75.7{\%}). Administrations with no interruptions (n = 2005) had a procedural failure rate of 69.6{\%} (n = 1395; 95{\%} CI, 67.6{\%}-71.6{\%}), which increased to 84.6{\%} (n = 148; 95{\%} CI, 79.2{\%}-89.9{\%}) with 3 interruptions. Overall, 25.0{\%} (n = 1067; 95{\%} CI, 23.7{\%}-26.3{\%}) of administrations had at least 1 clinical error. Those with no interruptions had a rate of 25.3{\%} (n = 507; 95{\%} CI, 23.4{\%}-27.2{\%}), whereas those with 3 interruptions had a rate of 38.9{\%} (n = 68; 95{\%} CI, 31.6{\%}-46.1{\%}). Nurse experience provided no protection against making a clinical error and was associated with higher procedural failure rates. Error severity increased with interruption frequency. Without interruption, the estimated risk of a major error was 2.3{\%}; with 4 interruptions this risk doubled to 4.7{\%} (95{\%} CI, 2.9{\%}-7.4{\%}; P {\textless} .001).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Among nurses at 2 hospitals, the occurrence and frequency of interruptions were significantly associated with the incidence of procedural failures and clinical errors.},

abstract = {We investigated whether mindfulness training (MT) influences information processing in a working memory task with complex visual stimuli. Participants were tested before (T1) and after (T2) participation in an intensive one-month MT retreat, and their performance was compared with that of an age- and education-matched control group. Accuracy did not differ across groups at either time point. Response times were faster and significantly less variable in the MT versus the control group at T2. Since these results could be due to changes in mnemonic processes, speed-accuracy trade-off, or nondecisional factors (e.g., motor execution), we used a mathematical modeling approach to disentangle these factors. The EZ-diffusion model (Wagenmakers, van der Maas, {\&} Grasman, Psychonomic Bulletin {\&} Review 14:(1), 3-22, 2007) suggested that MT leads to improved information quality and reduced response conservativeness, with no changes in nondecisional factors. The noisy exemplar model further suggested that the increase in information quality reflected a decrease in encoding noise and not an increase in forgetting. Thus, mathematical modeling may help clarify the mechanisms by which MT produces salutary effects on performance.},

We report an ongoing study of how people organize their computer files/folders on the hard disk of their office workstations, and discuss the questions being investigated as well as the results of a small survey with twelve subjects. Method. A questionnaire was used to collect information on the subjects, their work responsibilities and characteristics of their workstations. Data on file and folder names and file structure were extracted from the hard disk using a computer program STG FolderPrint Plus, DOS command and screen capture. A semi-structured interview collected information on subjects' strategies in naming and organizing files and folders, and in locating and retrieving files. Analysis. The data were analysed mainly through qualitative analysis and content analysis. Results. The subjects organized their folders in a variety of structures, from broad and shallow to narrow and deep hierarchies. One to three levels of folders is common. The labels for first level folders tended to be task-based or project-based. Most subjects located files by browsing the folder structure, with searching used as a last resort. The most common types of folder names were document type, organizational function/structure, and miscellaneous/temporary. The frequency of folders of different types appear related to the type of occupation. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {For decades, Fitts' law (1954) has been used to model pointing time in user interfaces. As with any rapid motor act, faster pointing movements result in increased errors. But although prior work has examined accuracy as the “spread of hits,” no work has formulated a predictive model for error rates (0-100{\%}) based on Fitts' law parameters. We show that Fitts' law mathematically implies a predictive error rate model, which we derive. We then describe an experiment in which target size, target distance, and movement time are manipulated. Our results show a strong model fit: a regression analysis of observed vs. predicted error rates yields a correlation of R2 = .959 for N = 90 points. Furthermore, we show that the effect on error rate of target size (W) is greater than that of target distance (A), indicating a departure from Fitts' law, which maintains that W and A contribute proportionally to index of difficulty (ID). Our error model can be used with Fitts' law to estimate and predict error rates along with speeds, providing a framework for unifying this dichotomy.},

@article{Grudin1990,
abstract = {This paper examines the evolution of the focus of user interface research and development from the first production of commercial computer systems in the 1950s through the present. The term “user interface” was not needed in the beginning, when most users were engineers and programmers; it may again become inappropriate when more applications are written for groups than for individuals. But there is a continuity to the outward movement of the computer's interface to its external environment, from hardware to software to increasingly higher-level cognitive capabilities and finally to social processes. As the focus shifts, the approaches to design and the skills required of practitioners changes. In this paper five foci or levels of development are identified. Most development today is positioned in the third level and considerable research is directed at the fourth. Some attention is now being given to the fifth: repositioning the interface in the work group or organization itself. Work at the different levels is not entirely independent, so establishing a comprehensive framework may enable us to position existing research and development efforts and plan future work more effectively.},

abstract = {Query Auto Completion (QAC) suggests possible queries to web search users from the moment they start entering a query. This popular feature of web search engines is thought to reduce physical and cognitive effort when formulating a query. Perhaps surprisingly, despite QAC being widely used, users' interactions with it are poorly understood. This paper begins to address this gap. We present the results of an in-depth user study of user interactions with QAC in web search. While study participants completed web search tasks, we recorded their interactions using eye-tracking and client-side logging. This allows us to provide a first look at how users interact with QAC. We specifically focus on the effects of QAC ranking, by controlling the quality of the ranking in a within-subject design. We identify a strong position bias that is consistent across ranking conditions. Due to this strong position bias, ranking quality affects QAC usage. We also find an effect on task completion, in particular on the number of result pages visited. We show how these effects can be explained by a combination of searchers' behavior patterns, namely monitoring or ignoring QAC, and searching for spelling support or complete queries to express a search intent. We conclude the paper with a discussion of the important implications of our findings for QAC evaluation.},

Yet, we do not have cognitive models that make this process explicit. On the basis of both recent experiments that have started to investigate mind-wandering and introspective knowledge from for example meditators, we built a process model of distraction in the form of mind-wandering. We then tested the model by predicting performance on tasks used in mind-wandering studies. We showed that we could both pre-dict task performance as well as the participants' responses to questions about what they were thinking about. This improved understanding of mind-wandering could be used in the future to revise our models of when, how, and why distraction occurs. For example, our model could be used to examine how the ef-fect of distraction on task performance depends on the type of mind-wandering (e.g., rumination versus day-dreaming).},

We found work to be highly fragmented: people average little time in working spheres before switching and 57{\%} of their working spheres are interrupted. Collocated people work longer before switching but have more interruptions. Most internal interruptions are due to personal work whereas most external interruptions are due to central work. Though most interrupted work is resumed on the same day, more than two intervening activities occur before it is.

abstract = {As a route to providing a framework for elucidating the content of public thinking concerning emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases (EID), this article examines public engagement with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). It explores how British lay publics represent MRSA utilising a social representations framework. For this group, MRSA is associated primarily with dirty National Health Service (NHS) hospitals that have been neglected due to management culture having superseded the matron culture that dominated the putative golden age of the NHS. Furthermore, MRSA represents a transgression of the purpose of a hospital as a clean and curative institution. While this widely shared picture is accompanied by a strong sense of general concern, the respondents associate contracting MRSA with other identities, such as hospitalised, young and old people. These associations are linked to feelings of personal invulnerability. There is also blame of foreigners - especially cleaners and nurses - for MRSA's spread. Thus, the data corroborate a key pattern of response found in relation to myriad EID - that of othering. However, the identities associated with contracting MRSA are mutable; therefore, the threat cannot be distanced unequivocally. Beyond developing an understanding of the relationship between epidemics and identities, this article proposes a fitting theory with which to explore EID-related public thinking.},

Four experiments are reported that examine the hypothesis that the cost of performing an operation affects "planfulness"--the level of planning during problem solving. The first experiment investigated problem solving with the 8-puzzle and compared strategies adopted when there was a high versus a low cost of making a move, manipulating cost in terms of command length. The second experiment used protocol analysis to provide more direct evidence for increased planning. The third and fourth experiments looked at the effects of these different strategies on learning: the third examined how problem solving performance on a direct manipulation interface is affected by prior problem solving experience in the same domain with either a high cost or low cost command-driven interface, demonstrating improved performance as a result of training on an interface with high cost operations; the fourth experiment, like the third, examined the effects of prior problem solving experience with either a high cost or low cost interface on subsequent problem solving performance in a different domain using a direct manipulation interface showing no effect to training interface on subsequent performance.},

Two rest break schedules were compared in a within-subjects design. Workers alternated between a 'conventional' and a 'supplementary' schedule in 4-week intervals. The conventional schedule contained a 15-min break during the first half of the work shift and a 15-min break during the second half of the shift. The supplementary schedule contained the same two 15-min breaks, and a 5-min break during each hour which otherwise did not contain a break, for a total of 20 extra minutes of break time.

Modeling human performance in a task often requires that special care be taken to understand how these millisecond level operations are interleaved and how they evolve during the execution of the task. In modeling a simple decision-making task, we found that human subjects improved their routine speed as they became more familiar with the task. Modeling was conducted using the ACT-R architecture (Anderson {\&} Lebiere, 1998). Refinements of the model indicated that interleaving of millisecond-level perceptual-motor and cognitive operators was crucial in accounting not only for the strategy shift as per soft constraints, but also in the marked speedup in performance over the course of several trials.},

Data was gathered through ethnographic observations and interviews. Data analysis consisted of constructing the representational models of DiCoT, focusing on information flows, physical layouts, social structures and artefacts. The findings show that there is significant distribution of cognition in the ICU: socially, among nurses; physically, through the material environment; and through technological artefacts. The DiCoT methodology facilitated the identification of potential improvements that could increase the safety and efficiency of nurses' interactions with infusion technology.},

abstract = {Systematic errors in performance are an important aspect of human behavior that have not received adequate explanation. One such systematic error is termed post-completion error; a typical example is leaving one's card in the automatic teller after withdrawing cash. This type of error seems to occur when people have an extra step to perform in a procedure after the main goal has been satisfied. The fact that people frequently make this type of error, but do not make this error every time, may best be explained by considering the working memory load at the time the step is to be performed: the error is made when the load on working memory is high, but will not be made when the load is low. A model of performance in the task was constructed using Just and Carpenter's (1992) CAPS that predicted that high working memory load should be associated with post-completion errors. Two experiments confirmed that such errors can be produced in a laboratory as well as a naturalistic setting, and that the conditions under which the CAPS model makes the error are consistent with the conditions under which the errors occur in the laboratory.},
annote = {- post-completion error
- people frequently make this error, but do not make it every time

Two experiments
- errors can be produced in laboratory as well as naturalistic setting

CAPS model
+ can vary working memory load capacity
+ allows to make errors, instead of assuming perfect execution
- does not simply delete goals when satisfied
- no learning mechanism (but people made less errors with practice)
- only focuses on post-completion error

Discussion
- shortage of lab data on systematic error
- lab simulation makes people more self-conscious and self-monitor more than they would otherwise
={\textgreater} solution: to generate errors that mirror naturalistic errors, use engaging game-like task that makes task seem less artificial, use more complex variants of simple tasks
- mistake to assume all errors are stochastic
- lack of theoretical guidance on error
- a lot has been learned about human memory by looking at kind of errors in recognition and recall; maybe same can be done about how people learn and execute procedures by looking at errors made

Conclusion
- post-completion errors should be avoided altogether
- working memory can easily become filled with task-irrelevant information (e.g. daydreaming); interface designer has no control over this},

abstract = {In two experiments, we studied how people's strategy choices emerge through an initial and then a more considered evaluation of available strategies. The experiments employed a computer-based paradigm where participants solved multiplication problems using mental and calculator solutions. In addition to recording responses and solution times, we gathered data on mouse cursor movements. Participants' motor behavior was revealing; although people rapidly initiated movement to the calculator box or the answer input box, they frequently changed their minds and went to the other box. Movement initiation direction depended on problem difficulty and calculator responsiveness. Ultimate strategy selection also depended on these factors, but was further influenced by movement initiation direction. We conclude that strategy selection is iterative, as revealed by these differences between early cursor movement and eventual strategy implementation. After rapidly initiating movement favoring one strategy, people carefully evaluate the applicability of that strategy in the current context. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

We examine one behavioral measure of the disruption caused by task interruption, namely the resumption lag, or the time needed to "collect one's thoughts" and restart a task after an interruption is over. The resumption lag (in our task environment) was double the interval between uninterrupted actions (3.8 s vs. 1.9 s), indicating a substantial disruptive effect. To probe the nature of the disruption, we examined the role of external cues associated with the interrupted task, finding that cues available immediately before an interruption facilitate performance immediately afterwards (reducing the resumption lag). This c u e-availability effect suggests that people deploy preparatory perceptual and memory processes, apparently spontaneously, to mitigate the disruptive effects of task interruption.},

abstract = {Typically, interface design attempts to minimize cognitive load by providing immediately accessible task-relevant information. However, this may have the unintended consequence of encouraging display-based strategies that minimize the degree of cognitive processing; a claim made by the soft constraints hypothesis (Gray, Sims, Fu, {\&} Schoelles, 2006). Increasing information access cost (IAC) induces a more memory-based strategy, and has been shown to improve performance following interruption in a visuospatial copying task (Morgan, Patrick, Waldron, King, {\&} Patrick, 2009). An experiment investigates whether the positive effect of increased IAC on interrupted performance extends to a problem solving task. A mouse movement and time delay to access information provoked a strategy that facilitated resumption and continuation of problem solving from memory, improved problem solving efficiency, and added no extra time cost to problem completion. The findings highlight the value of considering design solutions in light of the importance of different task performance criteria. Copyright 2010 by Human Factors and Ergonomics Society, Inc.

Partici-pants received explicit feedback on their performance on these tasks in the form of a single combined score. This payoff function was varied between conditions to change the value of one task relative to the other. We found that participants adapted their strategy for interleaving the two tasks, by varying how long they spent on one task before switching to the other, in order to achieve the near maximum payoff available in each condition. In a second experiment, we show that this behavior is learned quickly (within 2–3 min over several discrete trials) and remained stable for as long as the payoff function did not change. The results of this work show that people are adaptive and flexible in how they prioritize and allocate attention in a dual-task setting. However, it also demonstrates some of the limits regarding people's ability to optimize payoff functions.},

abstract = {Users routinely access cloud services through third-party apps on smartphones by giving apps login credentials (i.e., a username and password). Unfortunately, users have no assurance that their apps will properly handle this sensitive information. In this paper, we de-scribe the design and implementation of ScreenPass, which signifi-cantly improves the security of passwords on touchscreen devices. ScreenPass secures passwords by ensuring that they are entered se-curely, and uses taint-tracking to monitor where apps send pass-word data. The primary technical challenge addressed by Screen-Pass is guaranteeing that trusted code is always aware of when a user is entering a password. ScreenPass provides this guarantee through two techniques. First, ScreenPass includes a trusted soft-ware keyboard that encourages users to specify their passwords' domains as they are entered (i.e., to tag their passwords). Sec-ond, ScreenPass performs optical character recognition (OCR) on a device's screenbuffer to ensure that passwords are entered only through the trusted software keyboard. We have evaluated Screen-Pass through experiments with a prototype implementation, two in-situ user studies, and a small app study. Our prototype detected a wide range of dynamic and static keyboard-spoofing attacks and generated zero false positives. As long as a screen is off, not up-dated, or not tapped, our prototype consumes zero additional en-ergy; in the worst case, when a highly interactive app rapidly up-dates the screen, our prototype under a typical configuration intro-duces only 12{\%} energy overhead. Participants in our user studies tagged their passwords at a high rate and reported that tagging im-posed no additional burden. Finally, a study of malicious and non-malicious apps running under ScreenPass revealed several cases of password mishandling.},
