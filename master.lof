The most common strategy to collect information from physical sources was to prepare information before starting a data entry task. The most common strategy to collect information from digital sources was to interrupt and switch to the source during a data entry task.\relax }}{61}{figure.caption.43}

The rows indicate for which particular information source this behaviour was observed.\relax }}{64}{figure.caption.45}

At the start of each trial, participants were presented with a data entry form with two expense claims, and had to enter four data items in a data entry form. The data items were retrieved from a separate Amounts page (Step 1) and an Accounts page (Step 2) and entered into the data entry form (Step 3).\relax }}{94}{figure.caption.79}

Participants had to enter the items for the first form (Step 3) and second form (Step 4) before submitting the data entries and moving on to the next trial.\relax }}{107}{figure.caption.100}
