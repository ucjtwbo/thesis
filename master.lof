\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {4.3}{\ignorespaces The data entry task. At the start of each trial, participants were presented with a data entry form with two expense claims, and had to enter four data items in a data entry form. The participant had to switch to an Amounts window (Step 1), and switch back and enter the correct amount in the correct place on the form (Step 2). The participant then had to switch to the Account code window (Step 3) , and switch back and enter the correct amount in the correct place on the form (Step 4). Step 1-4 were repeated for the other items, until all four items had been looked up and entered. The participant can switch back and forth between windows as often as is needed.\relax }}{91}{figure.caption.71}

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {4.6}{\ignorespaces The sequence of the most common order of actions. V = visit to an information window, E = entry of a data item. For example, in Strategy (a) a participant first visited the Amounts window, and entered the Amount of the first expense, then visited the Account code window and entered the Account code of the first expense. He/she then viewed the Amounts window again and entered the Amount of the second expense, and then viewed the Accounts window and entered the second expense.\relax }}{98}{figure.caption.83}

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {4.8}{\ignorespaces Participants had to enter two data entry tasks per trial, each containing two items. Each trial started by showing the first data entry form. As in Study 4, the data items for both tasks were retrieved from a separate Amounts window (Step 1) and entering the items for the first expense (Step 2), and the second expense (Step 3). Participants had to repeat Steps 2 and 3 for the account codes, before submitting the data entries and moving on to the next trial. The participant could switch back and forth between windows as often as is needed\relax }}{106}{figure.caption.94}

It can be seen that in the Low condition, the line is even, which means that an even distribution of participants interleaved on all, a portion, or all trials. The lines of the High-Cost conditions peak at the right end, which means most participants in these conditions interleaved on at least a portion if not 100\% of all trials.\relax }}{110}{figure.caption.102}

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {5.1}{\ignorespaces A wireframe to indicate what the interaction with the intervention will look like. The upperleft corner shows the window of an expenses task the user has to complete. Information for this task is retrieved by switching to another window (Step 1). Upon every switch, a notification appears telling the user how long these switches are on average. The user then has to switch back and enter this information in the correct field (Step 2). Step 1 and 2 are repeated until all codes have been entered; the user can switch back and forth as often as is needed.\relax }}{121}{figure.caption.107}
