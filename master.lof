At the start of each trial, participants were presented with a data entry form with two expense claims, and had to enter four data items in a data entry form. The data items were retrieved by switching to an Amounts window (Step 1) and an Accounts window (Step 2) and entered into the data entry form (Step 3).\relax }}{90}{figure.caption.69}

For example, in Strategy (a) a participant first visited the Amounts window, and entered the Amount of the first expense, then visited the Account code window and entered the Account code of the first expense. He/she then viewed the Amounts window again and entered the Amount of the second expense, and then viewed the Accounts window and entered the second expense.\relax }}{98}{figure.caption.81}

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {4.8}{\ignorespaces Participants had to enter two data entry tasks per trial, each containing two items. Each trial started by showing the first data entry form. As in Study 4, the data items for both tasks were retrieved from a separate Amounts window (Step 1) and an Accounts window (Step 2). Participants had to enter the items for the first task (Step 3) and second task (Step 4) before submitting the data entries and moving on to the next trial.\relax }}{105}{figure.caption.92}

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {4.10}{\ignorespaces Line graph showing the frequency of interleaving rates for each condition. It can be seen that in the Control condition, the line is even, which means that an even distribution of participants interleaved on all, a portion, or all trials. The lines of the High-Cost conditions peak at the right end, which means most participants in these conditions interleaved on at least a portion if not 100\% of all trials.\relax }}{109}{figure.caption.100}
